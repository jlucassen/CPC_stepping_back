We can try to factor it by looking for two numbers that multiply to 41 (the constant term) and add up to 22 (the coefficient of the x term), but there are no such numbers.\n\nSWITCHING to the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\nOur \"a\" is 4, \"b\" is 22 and \"c\" is 41. \n\nThe roots are therefore x = [-22 \u00b1 sqrt((22)\u00b2 - 4 * 4 * 41)] / (2 * 4)\n=> x = [-22 \u00b1 sqrt(484 - 656)] / 8\n=> x = [-22 \u00b1 sqrt(-172)] / 8\n\nBecause the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (-172), the roots of the equation are complex numbers.\n\nWe could express them as real and imaginary parts, where sqrt(-1) is traditionally denoted as \"i\". \n\nLet's simplify \u221a-172 as \u221a172 * \u221a-1 = 13.1149i\n\nSo the roots are: x = [-22 \u00b1 13.1149i] / 8\n=> x = -2.75 \u00b1 1.63936i\n\nTherefore, the roots of the quadratic equation 4x\u00b2 + 22x + 41 = 0 are -2.75 - 1.63936i and -2.75 + 1.63936i."}
{"equation": "10x^2 + 34x + 14 = 0", "context": "Factorizing this equation is a bit complex. Therefore, let's use the quadratic formula right away. \n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a.\n\nSo, first, we identify a, b, and c from the equation 10x^2 + 34x + 14 = 0. We have:\n\na = 10\nb = 34\nc = 14\n\nNow, plug these into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-34 \u00b1 sqrt((34)^2 - 4*10*14)] / (2 * 10)\nx = [-34 \u00b1 sqrt((1156 - 560)] / 20\nx = [-34 \u00b1 sqrt(596)] / 20\n\nNow we take square root of 596,\nx = [-34 \u00b1 24.413] / 20\nx = [-34 + 24.413] / 20, [-34 - 24.413] / 20\n\nThis results in two roots of the equation:\n\nx = -0.4785, -1.4293\n\nPlease note, these are approximations and actual values may vary a little."}
