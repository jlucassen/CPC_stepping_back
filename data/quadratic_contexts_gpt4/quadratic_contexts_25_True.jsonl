{"equation": "368x^2 + 350x + 38 = 0", "context": "It's not very favorable to factor a quadratic equation with coefficients this large, but we will try it anyway.\n\n368x^2 + 350x + 38 = 0. \n\nIf we can express 368 as \"a times b\" and 38 as \"c times d\", where a, b, c, d are integers and ad + bc = 350, we got our factorization done. But the factors of 368 and 38 don't seem to meet this requirement no matter how we pair them up.\n\nNow, as factoring didn't work, we are SWITCHING to the quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by:\n\nx = [ -b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ] / 2*a\n\nFor our equation, a = 368, b = 350, and c = 38. Then we can substitute these values into the quadratic formula.\n\nx = [ -350 +/- sqrt((350)^2 - 4*(368)*(38)) ] / 2*368\n=> x = [ -350 +/- sqrt(122500 - 56064) ] / 736\n=> x = [ -350 +/- sqrt(66436) ] / 736\n=> x = [ -350 +/- 258] / 736\n=> x1 = -608 / 736 = -0.8260869565217391  and  x2 = 92 / 736 = 0.125"}
{"equation": "45x^2 + 288x + 108 = 0", "context": "This quadratic equation seems to be quite complex to factorise. The coefficients of the quadratic equation are significant numbers and finding exact factors might be troublesome. We can look at the two numbers, 45 and 108 but a pairs of factors that also sums up/differences to 288 is hard to find.\n\nSWITCHING\n\nGiven the quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0,\n\nThe roots can be found using the quadratic formula x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\na = 45 \nb = 288\nc = 108\n\nx = [-288 \u00b1 sqrt((288)\u00b2 - 4*45*108)] / (2*45)\n\n= [-288 \u00b1 sqrt(82944 - 19440)] / 90\n\n= [-288 \u00b1 sqrt(63504)] / 90\n\n= [-288 \u00b1 252] / 90\n\nThe roots will then be:\nx\u2081 = (-288 + 252) / 90 = -0.4\nx\u2082 = (-288 - 252) / 90 = -6\n\nTherefore, the roots of the quadratic equation 45x^2 + 288x + 108 = 0 are -0.4 and -6."}
