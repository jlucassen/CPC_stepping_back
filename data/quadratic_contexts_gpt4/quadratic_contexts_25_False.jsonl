{"equation": "48x^2 + 236x + 287 = 0", "context": "Attempting to find the roots by factoring 48x^2 + 236x + 287 = 0, it looks like this quadratic isn't easily factored. \n\nSWITCHING to the quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a). \n\nIn our equation, a is 48, b is 236, and c is 287.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the discriminant, which is b^2 - 4ac. This comes to 236^2 - 4*48*287 = 55696 - 55296 = 400.\n\nNow we can put it all into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-236 \u00b1 sqrt(400)] / (2*48)\n\nx = [-236 \u00b1 20] / 96 \n\nThat gives us two answers:\n\nx = -216/96 = -2.25\nx = -256/96 = -2.667\n\nSo the roots of the equation are x = -2.25 and x = -2.667."}
