Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (160 \u00b1 \u221a((-160)^2 - 4*5*1290)) / 2*5\nx = (160 \u00b1 \u221a(25600 - 25800)) / 10\nx = (160 \u00b1 \u221a(-200)) / 10\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we have imaginary roots for this equation."}
{"equation": "16x^2 - 368x + 975 = 0\n", "context": "To factor the equation 16x^2 - 368x + 975 = 0, we first need to find two numbers that multiply to 16*975 = 15600 and add up to -368.\n\nThe two numbers are -100 and -268.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n16x^2 - 100x - 268x + 975 = 0\n16x(x - 100) - 25(x - 100) = 0\n(16x - 25)(x - 100) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to 0 gives us the roots:\n16x - 25 = 0  =>  16x = 25  =>  x = 25/16\nx - 100 = 0  =>  x = 100\n\nTherefore, the roots of the equation 16x^2 - 368x + 975 = 0 are x = 25/16 and x = 100.\n\nBy using the quadratic formula:\nFor ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the roots are given by x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 16, b = -368, and c = 975.\n\nTherefore,\nx = (-(-368) \u00b1 \u221a((-368)^2 - 4*16*975)) / (2*16)\nx = (368 \u00b1 \u221a(135424 + 62400)) / 32\nx = (368 \u00b1 \u221a197824) / 32\nx = (368 \u00b1 444) / 32\n\nThis gives us two roots:\nx = (368 + 444) / 32 = 812 / 32 = 25.375\nx = (368 - 444) / 32 = -76 / 32 = -2.375\n\nTherefore, the roots of the equation 16x^2 - 368x + 975 = 0 are x = 25.375 and x = -2.375."}
