The factors of 800 that add up to -57 are -40 and -20. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(x - 40)(x - 20) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives us the roots:\n\nx - 40 = 0\nx = 40\n\nand\n\nx - 20 = 0\nx = 20\n\nSo, the two roots of the equation 10x^2 - 570x + 8000 = 0 are x = 40 and x = 20."}
