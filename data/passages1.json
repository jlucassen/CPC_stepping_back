    "For this problem, I need to prove that for any integer n greater than 1, if n is not a perfect square, then there exists some integer m such that m^2 < n < (m+1)^2.  \n\nLet me try a proof by mathematical induction:\n\nBase case: For n = 2, we can take m = 1. Then 1^2 < 2 < 2^2, so the statement holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume the statement is true for some integer k >= 2. We want to show it is also true for k+1.\nOkay, so k+1 is not a perfect square since k is not a perfect square. Because if k was m^2 for some m, then (m+1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 = k + 2m + 1 = k+1, which would mean k+1 is a perfect square, contradicting the premise.\n\nSince k is not a perfect square, by the inductive hypothesis, there exists some integer m such that m^2 < k < (m+1)^2. \n\nNow I need to find a way to show that there exists an integer m' such that (m')^2 < k+1 < (m'+1)^2...\nHmm. Well, let's see. Since m^2 < k, adding 1 to both sides gives m^2 + 1 < k + 1. But I can't easily relate that to (m')^2 in a clean way.\n\nMaybe if I worked backwards from (m+1)^2? No, that's not helping me isolate the m' value I need.\n\nLet me try a different approach - since k+1 is not a perfect square, there is no integer p such that p^2 = k+1. So k+1 must be between two perfect square values...but how do I determine what those values are in relation to the m value for k?\n\nDang, I've gotten myself turned around in a loop trying to relate m' to m and k in a way that maintains the inductive chain. This is incredibly messy and I'm struggling to find a coherent way to nicely prove the step for k+1 using the inductive hypothesis about k.\n\nOkay, I need to take a step back because I'm just going around in circles with this induction approach. It clearly isn't clicking intuitively for me on how to cleanly transition from the statement being true for k to being true for k+1 in a succinct way. I've spent too much time struggling to try to force this induction framework.\n\nLet me scrap it entirely and reframe my thinking from the ground up. Induction is a powerful technique, but it's clearly not the right tool for this particular proof about squared values and integerness. Maybe I need to restructure from first principles...\n\nIf n is not a perfect square, that means the square root of n is irrational. Which implies there is no integer m such that m^2 = n. However, we can still use the floor and ceiling functions to bound n between two consecutive perfect square integers that sandwich the irrational square root value...\n\nOkay, here's a much cleaner proof starting from the characterization of n not being a perfect square:\n\n1) Assume n > 1 is not a perfect square\n2) Then sqrt(n) is irrational  \n3) Let m = floor(sqrt(n)), which is the greatest integer <= sqrt(n)\n4) Since sqrt(n) > m, we have m^2 < n  \n5) Let m+1 be the least integer > sqrt(n)\n6) Since sqrt(n) < m+1, we have n < (m+1)^2\n7) Therefore, m^2 < n < (m+1)^2\n\nThis approach flows so much more cleanly by first establishing what it means for n to not be a perfect square, and then using basic properties of floor, ceiling, and inequalities to construct the m values that sandwich n.\n\nI'm quite relieved I decided to completely change tactics instead of stubbornly trying to force an induction proof. That was leaving me hopelessly tangled up. Whereas this reframed square root approach is elegant and generalizes perfectly.\n\nTesting it on examples:\n- For n = 5, m = 2 and 2^2 < 5 < 3^2  \n- For n = 20, m = 4 and 4^2 < 20 < 5^2\n\nLet me know if any part of this proof needs clarification! I'm glad I was able to talk through that pivotal moment of realizing I was spinning my wheels on an unproductive path, and needing to start fresh from a new perspective.",
    "Hmm, I need to prove this statement about prime numbers:\n\n'For any prime number p greater than 3, p is of the form 6n +/- 1 for some integer n.'\n\nOkay, let me start by trying to prove this directly using the definition of prime numbers.\n\nSuppose p is prime and p > 3. By the definition of a prime number, p is only divisible by 1 and itself...\n\n*Several lines of working*\n\nNo, this isn't going anywhere. I'm getting bogged down in messy arithmetic. There has to be a cleaner approach.\n\nMaybe I can look at this from a different angle - think about the possible remainder when dividing p by 6. Since p > 3, it can't be divisible by 2 or 3, so the possible remainders are 1, 5, -1, or -5 upon dividing by 6.\n\n*Scribbles some examples*\n\nAha! I'm seeing a pattern here. The primes I'm getting are always of the form 6n +/- 1. For example:\n5 = 6(0) + 5 \n7 = 6(1) + 1\n11 = 6(1) + 5\n13 = 6(2) - 1\n\nSo what I need to show is that any prime p > 3 cannot leave a remainder of 2, 3, or 4 when divided by 6. Okay, let's try proving that by contradiction...\n\nSuppose p leaves a remainder of 2 or 4 upon dividing by 6. Then p = 6n + 2 or p = 6n + 4 for some integer n.\n\nIn both cases, p is divisible by 2, which contradicts p being prime since primes > 3 cannot be divisible by 2.\n\nSimilarly, if p leaves a remainder of 3 upon dividing by 6, then p = 6n + 3. This implies p is divisible by 3, which also contradicts p being prime.\n\nTherefore, through contradiction, we've shown that any prime p > 3 cannot leave a remainder of 2, 3, or 4 upon dividing by 6.\n\nCombining this with the pattern I observed earlier, this means any prime p > 3 must be of the form 6n +/- 1, proving the original statement!\n\n*Writes out the complete proof steps neatly*\n\nWhew, that felt like quite the journey, but breaking it down into smaller pieces and looking at it from multiple angles helped get me to the solution. Proofs can be very tricky, but immensely satisfying when you finally crack them.",
    "Okay, the statement I need to prove is: \n\n'The sum of the angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees.'\n\nLet me first try to visualize this and see if any intuitive approaches come to mind.\n\n*Draws a few quadrilateral examples*\n\nHmm, I can't really 'see' why the sum would always be 360 degrees just by looking at the shapes. The quadrilaterals can take on so many different formations.\n\nMaybe I can try to prove this by breaking it down into smaller pieces...\n\nSuppose I have some arbitrary quadrilateral ABCD. If I construct a diagonal AC that splits it into two triangles ABC and ACD:\n\n*Draws diagram*\n\nFor any triangle, I know the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees by the Triangle Sum Theorem.\n\nSo for ΔABC, the sum of its angles is 180 degrees.\nAnd for ΔACD, the sum of its angles is also 180 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the angles in the original quadrilateral ABCD is:\n180 (for ΔABC) + 180 (for ΔACD) = 360 degrees\n\nAh but wait, in adding up the angles this way, I've double counted the angle at A, and also the one at C where the two triangles overlap.\n\nSo I need to subtract those two overlapping angles from the total:\n360 - A - C = Sum of angles in the quadrilateral\n\nHmm, but I don't know what A and C are. This approach still doesn't prove it for all possible quadrilaterals.\n\nOkay, let me go back to the beginning and try a different tactic...\n\n*Starts over*\n\nInstead of splitting it into triangles, let me try rearranging the quadrilateral in a clever way.\n\nIf I take ABCD, and create a new shape by drawing lines from one vertex to a point on the opposite side, I can split it into two pairs of triangles:\n\n*Draws diagram*\n\nSo I've broken the quadrilateral into ΔABE and ΔCDE, with a overlapping ΔBCE in the middle.\n\nFor ΔABE and ΔCDE, each has a sum of angles of 180 degrees.\nAnd for ΔBCE, it has a sum of angles of 180 degrees.  \n\nTherefore, in total, the sum is:\n180 + 180 + 180 = 540 degrees\n\nBut again, I've double counted some angles where the triangles overlap. The angles at B, C, and E are each counted twice.\n\nSo I need to subtract out these overlapping angles from the total:\n540 - B - C - E = Sum of angles in quadrilateral\n\nThis time, since B + C + E must equal 180 degrees (they form ΔBCE), I can substitute:\n540 - 180 = 360 degrees\n\nYes! By cleverly rearranging the quadrilateral, I was able to show that its sum of angles must be 360 degrees for any possible quadrilateral.\n\nWhew, that was a tricky one. The key was looking at it from multiple perspectives and not getting stuck in any one unfruitful approach. Breaking it down, rearranging, and using known results about triangles ultimately led me to the solution.",
    "I need to prove the following statement:\n\n'The sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n^2.'\n\nLet me first try a direct proof by induction on n. \n\nBase Case (n=1):  \nThe first odd positive integer is 1. \n1^2 = 1, so the statement holds for n=1.\n\nInductive Step: Assume the statement holds for some k >= 1, that is, the sum of the first k odd positive integers is k^2. Now consider k+1:\n\nSum of the first k+1 odd positive integers \n= Sum of the first k odd positive integers + the (k+1)th odd positive integer\n= k^2 + (2k+1)    [Using the inductive hypothesis, and the (k+1)th odd is 2k+1]\n= k^2 + 2k + 1\n= (k+1)^2\n\nSo if the statement holds for k, it also holds for k+1, completing the induction.\n\n*Pauses to review*\n\nHmm, something doesn't seem quite right. The arithmetic worked out, but I have a nagging feeling this proof isn't airtight. \n\nLet me try a different approach - maybe a visualization will help. I'll list out the first few odd positive integers and their partial sums:\n\n1 \n1 + 3 = 4\n1 + 3 + 5 = 9  \n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16\n...\n\nI'm noticing that the sum of the first n odd integers always takes the form of a square number! And the pattern is, the nth odd number is (2n-1).\n\nSo the sum of the first n odd integers is:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) \n\nIf I can show that this sum is equal to n^2, that will prove the statement.\n\nLet's try this:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) \n= [1 + (2n-1)] + [2 + (2n-2)] + ... + [n + n]\n= 2n + 2(n-1) + 2(n-2) + ... + 2(1)\n= 2n(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)\n\nNow I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which states that the sum from 1 to n is (n(n+1))/2.\n\nSubstituting this in:\n2n(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 2n * (n(n+1))/2 \n                     = n^2(n+1)\n                     = n^2 + n^2 \n                     = n^2\n\nYes! By breaking it down step-by-step and finding the right visualization, I was able to complete the proof.\n\n*Writes the complete proof neatly*\n\nBreaking it into smaller pieces and trying multiple approaches was crucial. Mathematical proofs really require working through all the intuition and potential dead-ends before finding that elegant solution.",
    "Okay, the statement I need to prove is:\n\n'The sum of the angles of any convex polygon with n sides is (n - 2) * 180 degrees.'\n\nTo start, I should try to gather some basic intuition about this problem. Let me draw out a few polygons and visualize the angles:\n\n*Draws a triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon*\n\nHmm, looking at these examples, it does seem like the total angle sum is related to the number of sides. The more sides, the larger the total angle sum.\n\nBut how can I formalize this into an actual proof? I need to find a way to represent the angle sum algebraically in terms of n.\n\nOne approach could be to break each polygon down into triangles. That might allow me to relate the total angle sum to the sum of the angles in multiple triangles which is 180 degrees.\n\n*Sketches breaking a quadrilateral into two triangles*\n\nOkay, let's try building up the proof from this approach of dissecting into triangles:\n\nLet the number of sides of the polygon be n. \nTo break this polygon into triangles, I need to draw (n - 2) lines from one vertex to the remaining vertices.\n\nSo the polygon gets divided into (n - 2) triangles.\nIn each triangle, the angle sum is 180 degrees.\nTherefore, the total angle sum for the (n - 2) triangles is: (n - 2) * 180 degrees.\n\nSince these (n - 2) triangles completely make up the original n-sided polygon, without double counting any angles, the total angle sum for the polygon is also (n - 2) * 180 degrees!\n\nTo solidify the proof, let me verify this algebraically by induction on n:\n\nBase case: For n = 3 (a triangle)\nNumber of triangles formed = 3 - 2 = 1\nAngle sum = 1 * 180 = 180 degrees \nWhich is correct, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180.\n\nInductive step: Assume the formula holds for some n = k\nThat is, the total angle sum for a k-gon is (k - 2) * 180 degrees\n\nNow, consider a (k + 1)-gon\nThis is formed by adding one more side to the original k-gon\nWhich means one more triangle is formed \nSo the (k + 1)-gon is made up of (k - 2 + 1) = (k - 1) triangles\n\nUsing the inductive hypothesis, the angle sum of the original k triangles is: \n(k - 2) * 180 degrees\n\nAnd the angle sum of the new additional triangle is 180 degrees\n\nSo the total angle sum of the (k + 1)-gon = [(k - 2) * 180] + 180\n                                         = (k - 1) * 180 degrees\n\nHence, the formula holds for the (k + 1) case as well! By the principle of induction, this proves the formula is true for any n-gon.\n\nPhew, breaking it down into cases, using triangles as a building block, and validating with induction allowed me to finally construct this proof. Mathematical proofs can definitely require trying multiple approaches before finding one that works!",
    "Okay, let me read the statement to prove:\n\n'The sum of the cubes of any three consecutive natural numbers is divisible by 9.'\n\nHmm...this seems like it could involve some algebraic manipulation. Let me start by letting the three consecutive numbers be n, n+1, and n+2. \n\nThen I need to show that n^3 + (n+1)^3 + (n+2)^3 is divisible by 9 for any natural number n.\n\nLet me expand the cubes first:\nn^3 + (n+1)^3 + (n+2)^3\n= n^3 + (n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1) + (n^3 + 6n^2 + 12n + 8)\n= 3n^3 + 9n^2 + 15n + 9\n\nOkay, so the terms have combined into a nice polynomial expression. But how can I show this is divisible by 9 for any value of n?\n\n*Thinks for a bit*\n\nYou know what, let me put this polynominal into a different form, taking out a factor of n^2:\n3n^3 + 9n^2 + 15n + 9 \n= 3n^2(n + 3) + 9(n + 2)\n\nNow I'm seeing something! The term (n + 3) is always divisible by 3 since n is an integer. \n\nAnd (n + 2) is one less than a multiple of 3, so it can be written as 3k - 1 for some integer k.\n\nSubstituting this in:\n3n^2(n + 3) + 9(3k - 1)\n= 3n^2(n + 3) + 27k - 9\n= 9(n^2(n + 3) + 3k - 1)\n\nSo the entire expression is equal to 9 times something!\n\nThis proves that for any natural number n, the sum of the cubes of the three consecutive numbers n, n+1, n+2 is divisible by 9!\n\n*Writes out full proof steps*\n\nPhew, that was a fun little algebraic proof.

    "'Prove that for any natural number n, the sum (n^3 + (n+1)^3 + ... + (2n)^3) is divisible by n^2(n+1)^2.'\n\nWhew, that's quite an expression to work with. Let me start by trying to understand the pattern.\n\nFor n = 1, the expression becomes: 1^3 + 2^3 = 1 + 8 = 9\nAnd 1^2 * 2^2 = 1 * 4 = 4, which does divide 9.\n\nFor n = 2, it's: 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 27 + 64 = 99  \nAnd 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36, which again divides 99.\n\nOkay, so it checks out for the first few cases at least. But how can I prove this algebraically for any n?\n\n*Stares at the expression for a while*\n\nYou know what, let me rewrite this sum as a polynomial first:\n(n^3 + (n+1)^3 + ... + (2n)^3) \n= n^3 + (n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1) + (n^3 + 6n^2 + 12n + 8) + ... + (n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 27)\n\nMaybe I can factor out some common terms? Let's see...that's n^3 repeated (2n - n + 1) = n times. And the coefficients of the n^2 terms are (3 + 6 + ... + 9) which is the triangular number sum (n(n+1))/2 * 3 = (3n(n+1))/2\n\nSubstituting this in:\nn^3 * n + (3n(n+1)n^2)/2 + (some extra terms)\n\nHmm still quite messy. Let me try another approach...\n\n*Thinks some more* \n\nAha! I have an idea - what if I difference this sum from a related sum that I can evaluate?\n\nLet the related sum be: (n^3 + (n+1)^3 + ... + (2n+1)^3)\n\nThen: (new sum - original sum) \n    = (n^3 + ... + (2n+1)^3) - (n^3 + ... + (2n)^3)\n    = (2n+1)^3\n\nThis telescopes down to a single cubic term! And a cubic is always divisible by the squared terms in its factors.\n\nSo if I can show that (2n+1)^3 is divisible by n^2(n+1)^2, then the original sum must also be divisible by it!\n\nOkay, let's expand that cubic:\n(2n+1)^3 = 8n^3 + 12n^2 + 6n + 1\n            = (2n(2n+1))(2n+1) \n            = 4n^2(n+1)(2n+1)\n\nWhich clearly has n^2(n+1)^2 as a factor!\n\nTherefore, the original sum (n^3 + ... + (2n)^3) is also divisible by n^2(n+1)^2, proving the statement!\n\n*Writes out the full proof steps neatly*\n\nPhew, that was a long and winding road, but breaking it down into smaller pieces and trying different techniques like using a related sum helped immensely.

    "Sure, let's take on a slightly more involved proof problem.

    "Okay, this is the statement I need to prove:\n\n'For any integer n greater than 1, if n is not a perfect square, then there exists a unique pair of consecutive odd numbers whose product is n.'\n\nThis seems like it could get fairly intricate with several cases to consider. But I'll take it step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let me try to rephrase and reframe the statement in a way that feels more approachable:\n\nI need to show that for any integer n > 1 that is not a square number, I can always find two odd integers a and b with a + 2 = b, such that a * b = n. And this representation with consecutive odds must be unique.\n\nHmm...let me think about this by breaking it down into two parts:\n1) Proving the existence of such a pair a, b \n2) Proving the uniqueness\n\nFor the first part, I can probably use proof by contradiction. Suppose there is no such pair a, b of consecutive odds with a * b = n.\n\nThen n cannot be written as a product of any two odd numbers, since all the odds differ by 2.\n\n*Scribbles some working*\n\nAha, I've got it! If n cannot be written as a product of two odd numbers, then it must be able to be written as 2^k * m for some integers k >= 1 and odd m >= 1.\n\nWhy? Well, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, n's prime factorization contains only powers of 2 (2^k) and an odd number m.\n\nBut this implies n is a perfect square! Since m is odd, m = (2i+1) for some i. Then:\n\nn = 2^k * m \n   = 2^k * (2i+1)\n   = (2^(k+i))^2\n\nSo n is a perfect square, which contradicts the initial assumption that n is not a square number.\n\nThrough this contradiction, I've shown that for any n > 1 that is not a square, n must be able to be written as a product of two odd numbers a and b.\n\nBy a similar line of reasoning, since a and b are consecutives odds, we get that a*b is odd, so this representation is unique.\n\nWhew, that was quite involved! Splitting it into two parts, using contradiction, leveraging number theory results, and careful logical deductions helped me construct the full proof.\n\nLet me go over it again and write out the complete steps clearly to make sure I have it all.\n\n*Writes out the full proof neatly with all steps*",

    "Write a program to find the length of the longest consecutive increasing sequence from an array of integers.\n\n\"Okay, for this coding interview question to find the length of the longest consecutive increasing sequence from an array of integers...let me start with a basic brute force approach of comparing each number to the next number in the array.\n\n```python\ndef soln(nums):\n    max_seq = 0\n    curr_seq = 1\n    for i in range(len(nums)-1):\n        if nums[i] + 1 == nums[i+1]:\n            curr_seq += 1\n        else:\n            curr_seq = 1\n        max_seq = max(max_seq, curr_seq)\n    return max_seq\n```\n\nHmm, but stepping through this I can see it won't be very efficient for cases with large ranges of numbers, since I may need to check every single pair. There are definitely better ways than this nested loop.\n\nLet me try sorting the array first, then I can just walk through linearly and check the differences between consecutive numbers:\n\n```python\ndef soln(nums):\n    nums.sort()\n    max_seq = 1\n    curr_seq = 1\n    for i in range(len(nums)-1):\n        if nums[i] + 1 == nums[i+1]:\n            curr_seq += 1\n        else:\n            curr_seq = 1\n        max_seq = max(max_seq, curr_seq)\n    return max_seq\n```\n\nThis sorted approach is simplifying the comparisons, but I'm still getting tripped up on effectively tracking the longest overall sequence. I may need to reevaluate my entire technique.\n\nHmm...what if I use a set or hash table to track the sequences as I go? I can add each new number, and check if it continues the existing sequence by looking at the previous number.\n\n```python\ndef soln(nums):\n    num_set = set(nums)\n    max_seq = 0\n\n    for n in nums:\n        if n - 1 not in num_set: \n            curr = n\n            curr_seq = 1\n\n            while curr + 1 in num_set:\n                curr += 1\n                curr_seq += 1\n\n            max_seq = max(max_seq, curr_seq)\n\n    return max_seq\n```\n\nOkay, now I'm feeling good about this set approach correctly identifying the longest sequence by updating the maximum whenever I reach the end of a consecutive run. It's reasonably efficient since I only need to check the existance in the set.\n\nLet me double check some test cases:\n```python\nprint(soln([3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12]))  # 3\nprint(soln([3, 1, 0, 2, 9, 4]))     # 4\nprint(soln([0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1])) # 6\n```\n\nLooks good! I think this final set-based approach really nails the requirements for finding the longest consecutive increasing sequence accurately and efficiently. I'll wrap up my solution like this for the coding interview.",
    "How about implementing an algorithm for the \"Word Break\" problem:\n\nThe Word Break problem is: Given a string (e.g. \"catsanddog\") and a dictionary of valid words (e.g. [\"cats\", \"and\", \"dog\"]), determine if the string can be fully segmented into dictionary words.\n\nOkay, for this 'Word Break' problem where I need to determine if a given string can be fully segmented into words from a dictionary...let me start with a basic brute force recursion approach.\n\n```python\ndef word_break(s, word_dict):\n    def compose(soFar, remaining):\n        if not remaining:\n            output.append(soFar.split())\n            return\n        for i in range(1, len(remaining)+1):\n            if remaining[:i] in word_dict:\n                compose(soFar + \" \" + remaining[:i], remaining[i:])\n        \n    output = []\n    compose(\"\", s)\n    return bool(output)\n```\n\nHmm, while this recursion explores all potential segmentation paths, it's incredibly inefficient for even moderate size inputs since there is heavy repetition of work. I'm going to hit the max recursion depth really quickly on non-trivial cases.\n\nPerhaps I can try building up the solution from the beginning using dynamic programming and memoization...\n\n```python \ndef word_break(s, word_dict):\n    memo = {}\n    def recurse(start):\n        if start == len(s): return True\n        if start in memo: return memo[start] \n        for end in range(start+1, len(s)+1):\n            if s[start:end] in word_dict and recurse(end):\n                memo[start] = True\n                return True\n        memo[start] = False\n        return False\n    return recurse(0)\n```\n\nHmm this top-down DP approach with memoization is helping reduce duplicate operations, but I'm still really hung up on indexing issues and bugs when segmenting the string correctly. I feel like I'm going a very roundabout way here when there might be a more natural solution approach.\n\nLet me try to break this down into simpler subproblems working from the bottom up...what if I first just check if each possible prefix of the string exists as a dictionary word? Then I can build up from those valid prefixes.\n\n```python\ndef word_break(s, word_dict):\n    word_dict = set(word_dict)\n    dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)\n    dp[0] = True\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(s)+1):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_dict:\n                dp[i] = True\n                break\n                \n    return dp[len(s)]\n```\n\nOkay, this bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a boolean array to track valid prefixes is finally starting to come together nicely. At each position, I check if any previous position's prefix concatenated with the new substring forms a valid word.\n\nLet me test out some examples to validate:\n\n```python\nprint(word_break(\"catsanddog\", [\"cats\", \"and\", \"dog\"])) # True\nprint(word_break(\"ccacbbc\", [\"c\", \"ca\", \"bc\"])) # True \nprint(word_break(\"code\", [\"c\", \"o\", \"do\"])) # True\nprint(word_break(\"wouldyou\", [\"I\", \"could\", \"use\", \"a\", \"you\"])) # False\n```\n\nLooking good! I'm feeling confident that this final bottom-up DP approach efficiently solves the Word Break problem by systematically building up valid prefixes.\n\nThe key was realizing I needed to restructure the whole problem around identifying valid prefixes, instead of trying to segment the whole string from scratch recursively or manage complicated indexing.\n\nOverall this was a very tricky problem that forced me to pivot strategies a few times, but breaking it down into overlapping subproblems and leveraging dynamic programming on the prefix validity ultimately unlocked the solution.",
    "How about the \"Word Ladder\" problem:\n\nThe task is to find the minimum number of steps required to transform one word into another word, where a step involves changing one letter at a time while ensuring all intermediate words are valid words from a given dictionary.\n\nFor example, if the start word is \"hit\" and the end word is \"cog\", one possible transformation would be:\nhit -> hot -> dot -> dog -> cog\n\nWith a dictionary that includes {\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\",\"cog\"}, this transformation has a minimum step count of 5.\n\nHere's what the interviewee's monologue could look like thinking through multiple approaches:\n\n\"Okay, for this 'Word Ladder' problem where I need to find the minimum number of steps to transform one word into another by changing one letter at a time while only using valid intermediate words...let me start with a breadth-first search approach, building it out from the start word level-by-level.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList):\n    wordList = set(wordList)\n    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])\n    \n    while queue:\n        word, steps = queue.popleft()\n        if word == endWord:\n            return steps\n        \n        for i in range(len(word)):\n            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n                next_word = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]\n                if next_word in wordList:\n                    wordList.remove(next_word)\n                    queue.append((next_word, steps + 1))\n                    \n    return 0\n```\n\nHmm, this BFS implementation works by generating all possible words that differ by one letter from the current word. It's building the full transformation sequence level-by-level until it hits the endWord.\n\nBut I can already see this may be very inefficient for large dictionary sizes. I'm having to check every possible single letter change at each level, which could balloon exponentially for longer word lengths.\n\nLet me try optimizing this by pruning the BFS to only explore words that are one step away from the start and end words. That way I don't waste time exploring irrelevant words.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque  \n\ndef ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList):\n    wordList = set(wordList)\n    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])\n    endQueue = deque([(endWord, 1)]) \n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue and endQueue:\n        if len(queue) > len(endQueue):\n            queue, endQueue = endQueue, queue\n        \n        curr_word, steps = queue.popleft()\n        for i in range(len(curr_word)):\n            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n                next_word = curr_word[:i] + c + curr_word[i+1:]\n                if next_word in endQueue:\n                    return steps + endQueue[0][1]\n                if next_word in wordList:\n                    wordList.remove(next_word)  \n                    queue.append((next_word, steps + 1))\n                    \n    return 0\n```\n\nOkay, this bi-directional BFS searching from both the start and end words is a bit better as it can find the intersection point faster once the search fronts overlap. I'm also using a visited set to avoid duplicate work.\n\nHowever, I'm still concerned this brute force approach checking all one-letter changes will get bogged down for more complex cases. Let me rethink using a completely different strategy...\n\nWhat if I model this as a graph problem where each word is a node, and there's an edge between any two words that differ by only one letter? Then I can apply Dijkstra's algorithm or other shortest path approaches to efficiently find the minimum transformation sequence.\n\n```python \nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList):\n    wordList = set(wordList)\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for word in wordList:\n        for i in range(len(word)):\n            pattern = word[:i] + \"*\" + word[i+1:]\n            graph[pattern].append(word)\n            \n    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)]) \n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        curr_word, steps = queue.popleft()\n        if curr_word == endWord:\n            return steps\n        visited.add(curr_word)\n        \n        for i in range(len(curr_word)):\n            pattern = curr_word[:i] + \"*\" + curr_word[i+1:] \n            neighbors = graph[pattern]\n            for neighbor in neighbors:\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    visited.add(neighbor)\n                    queue.append((neighbor, steps + 1))\n                    \n    return 0\n```\n\nAh I'm feeling much better about this graph/Dijkstra's algorithm approach now. By precomputing the lists of neighboring words that differ by one letter, I can efficiently explore the shortest path without redundant work.\n\nThe key optimization is using a pattern like \"hit*\" to group together all words that match that wildcard pattern. This lets me quickly find all potential one-letter change neighbors for the current word.\n\nLet me test it out on the example case:\n\n```python\nbeginWord = \"hit\"\nendWord = \"cog\"\nwordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\",\"cog\"]\nprint(ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList))  # 5\n```\n\nAnd a more complex case:\n\n```python\nbeginWord = \"qa\"  \nendWord = \"sq\"\nwordList = [\"si\",\"go\",\"se\",\"cm\",\"so\",\"ph\",\"mt\",\"db\",\"mb\",\"sb\",\"kr\",\"ln\",\"tm\",\"le\",\"av\",\"sm\",\"ar\",\"ci\",\"ca\",\"br\",\"ti\",\"ba\",\"to\",\"ra\",\"fa\",\"yo\",\"ow\",\"sn\",\"ya\",\"cr\",\"po\",\"fe\",\"ho\",\"ma\",\"re\",\"or\",\"rn\",\"au\",\"ur\",\"rh\",\"sr\",\"tc\",\"lt\",\"lo\",\"as\",\"fr\",\"nb\",\"yb\",\"if\",\"pb\",\"ge\",\"th\",\"pm\",\"rb\",\"sh\",\"co\",\"ga\",\"li\",\"ha\",\"hz\",\"no\",\"bi\",\"di\",\"hi\",\"qa\",\"pi\",\"os\",\"uh\",\"wm\",\"an\",\"me\",\"mo\",\"na\",\"la\",\"st\",\"er\",\"sc\",\"ne\",\"mn\",\"mi\",\"am\",\"ex\",\"pt\",\"io\",\"be\",\"fm\",\"ta\",\"tb\",\"ni\",\"mr\",\"pa\",\"he\",\"lr\",\"sq\",\"ye\"]\nprint(ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList)) # 5\n```\n\nLooks good! I'm confident this final graph-based approach using Dijkstra's algorithm can efficiently find the minimum transformation for the Word Ladder problem, even with large dictionaries. Let me wrap up my coding solution.",
    "For this coding interview question, I need to write a function that takes a string consisting of just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', and determines if the input string is valid based on having properly nested and matching pairs of these brackets. \n\nOkay, let me start with a basic approach using a stack to push and pop the opening brackets, checking that each closing bracket matches the most recent open bracket:\n\n```python\ndef soln(s):\n    stack = []\n    open_to_close = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char in open_to_close:\n            stack.append(char)\n        else:\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            open_char = stack.pop()\n            if open_to_close[open_char] != char:\n                return False\n            \n    return len(stack) == 0\n```\n\nHmm, this works for basic cases by matching each closing bracket to the most recent opening bracket on the stack. But I'm realizing it doesn't handle cases with improperly nested brackets in the middle, like '({)}'.\n\nLet me try reversing the string and doing the same stack approach backwards to validate from the end:\n\n```python \ndef soln(s):\n    stack = []\n    open_to_close = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']', \n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    close_to_open = {v:k for k, v in open_to_close.items()}\n    \n    for char in reversed(s):\n        if char in close_to_open:\n            stack.append(char)\n        else:\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            close_char = stack.pop()\n            if close_to_open[close_char] != char:\n                return False\n            \n    return len(stack) == 0\n```\n\nWait, but this still doesn't quite work for cases like '()[]{}'. The opening brackets are matched properly from one end, and the closing from the other, but the overall nesting is invalid.\n\nOkay, let me step back and think about this more holistically. What if I use two stacks - one for the opening brackets as I see them, and one for the closing brackets in the order I see them?\n\n```python\ndef soln(s):\n    open_stack = []\n    close_stack = []\n    open_to_close = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char in open_to_close:\n            open_stack.append(open_to_close[char])\n        else:\n            if not open_stack or char != open_stack.pop():\n                return False\n            elif not close_stack:\n                close_stack.append(char)\n            else:\n                close_paren = close_stack.pop()\n                if char != close_paren:\n                    return False\n                    \n    return len(open_stack) == 0 and len(close_stack) == 0\n```\n\nHmm I'm still getting tripped up on some test cases with this dual stack approach...maybe I need to more thoroughly think through the rules.\n\nThe key is that any closing bracket I see must match the most recent opening bracket of that type. And any opening brackets should be matched 1-to-1 with closing brackets in the proper order.\n\nWhat if I use a single stack, but push the opening bracket types themselves, and then when I see a closing bracket, I pop from the stack and check if the opening type matches?\n\n```python \ndef soln(s):\n    stack = []\n    open_to_close = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    close_to_open = {v:k for k, v in open_to_close.items()}\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char in open_to_close:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif not stack or open_to_close[stack.pop()] != char:\n            return False\n        \n    return len(stack) == 0\n```\n\nOkay, now going through test cases like:\n```python\nprint(soln(\"(){}[]\"))  # True\nprint(soln(\"([)]\"))    # False\nprint(soln(\"{[]}\"))    # True\nprint(soln(\"{(])\"))    # False\n```\n\nThis final single stack approach using the opening bracket types seems to be accurately validating the nested, properly matched bracket sequences! By pushing the opening types, I can match any closing bracket to the most recent unmatched opening type.\n\nI went through multiple techniques - from the start and end, using dual stacks - but the key was realizing I needed to keep track of the opening bracket types themselves in order to validate the proper nesting.",
    "For this coding interview question, I need to write a function that takes a non-empty array of integers and finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the input array. \n\nTo start, I'll try a basic brute force approach of calculating the sum for every possible subarray and keeping track of the maximum:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarraySum(nums):\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    \n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        curr_sum = 0\n        for j in range(i, len(nums)):\n            curr_sum += nums[j]\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\n            \n    return max_sum\n```\n\nOkay, this will work to find the maximum subarray sum by exhaustively checking all possible subarrays. But it's incredibly inefficient with the nested loops, giving a time complexity of O(n^2). There has to be a better way than checking every subarray.\n\nLet me try using dynamic programming to only have to check each element once. I can keep track of the current running maximum subarray sum as well as the global maximum:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarraySum(nums):\n    max_so_far = max_ending_here = nums[0]\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        max_ending_here = max(nums[i], max_ending_here + nums[i])\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n        \n    return max_so_far\n```\n\nHmm, this dynamic programming approach handles cases like [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4] much better by continually updating the max ending at the current element. But I'm realizing it doesn't properly handle cases where all elements are negative numbers.\n\nIn those negative number cases, we'd actually want to return the single largest negative number as the \"maximum\" subarray sum.\n\nLet me try restructuring this as a min/max problem using Kadane's algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarraySum(nums):\n    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0\n    min_ending_here = min_so_far = 0\n    \n    for n in nums:\n        max_ending_here = max(n, max_ending_here + n)  \n        min_ending_here = min(n, min_ending_here + n) \n        \n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, min_ending_here)\n        \n    return max_so_far if max_so_far != 0 else max(nums)\n```\n\nOkay, by tracking both the maximum and minimum subarray sums, I can handle the case where all numbers are negative by just returning the largest individual element.\n\nLet's validate this solution:\n\n```python\nprint(maxSubarraySum([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4])) # 6\nprint(maxSubarraySum([1])) # 1 \nprint(maxSubarraySum([-1, -2, -3])) # -1\n```\n\nLooking good! This final Kadane's algorithm approach has a linear time complexity and successfully handles all cases by dynamically tracking the max/min subarrays.\n\nI first tried a brute force method of checking every subarray, which was horribly inefficient. Then I pivoted to a dynamic programming technique, but it couldn't handle negative numbers properly. Finally, rethinking it as a min/max problem using Kadane's algorithm solved the issue elegantly.",
    "For this coding question, I need to write a function that takes a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, where 1s represent fresh oranges and 0s represent rotten oranges. The rotten oranges can contaminate the fresh oranges in the 4 orthogonal directions on each minute. I have to determine the minimum number of minutes for all the fresh oranges to become rotten given the initial grid.\n\nOkay, let's think through this step-by-step. We're dealing with a matrix and need to model the contamination process over time. It feels like we may need to use some sort of breadth-first search to ripple out the contamination.\n\nLet me first try a basic BFS approach, starting from the initially rotten orange positions:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef soln(grid):\n    fresh = 0\n    queue = deque()\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                fresh += 1\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                \n    if fresh == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    minutes = 0\n    directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]\n    \n    while queue:\n        size = len(queue)\n        for i in range(size):\n            r, c = queue.popleft()\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                    grid[nr][nc] = 2\n                    fresh -= 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n        if queue:\n            minutes += 1\n            \n    return -1 if fresh > 0 else minutes\n```\n\nOkay, this does a basic BFS from the initial rotten positions to contaminate all neighboring fresh oranges recursively. It keeps track of the remaining fresh oranges and minutes elapsed.\n\nHmm, let me test it on some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]])) # 4\nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]])) # -1 \nprint(soln([[0,2]])) # 0\n```\n\nIt seems to work okay for simple cases, but I get stuck in certain edge cases. Like what if the initial rotten oranges are disconnected from the fresh oranges? Or what if there are fresh orange regions entirely enclosed by rotten oranges that can never be contaminated?\n\nI think I need to rethink my overall strategy here. Instead of modeling the contamination process itself, maybe I should try to identify the different fresh regions first.\n\nLet me try using a DFS approach to find all fresh orange regions, then calculate the minimum contamination path to each region:\n\n```python\ndef soln(grid):\n    fresh = 0\n    regions = {}\n    region_id = 0\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    \n    def dfs(r, c, id):\n        if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and grid[r][c] == 1:\n            grid[r][c] = id\n            regions.setdefault(id, []).append((r, c))\n            dfs(r-1, c, id)\n            dfs(r+1, c, id)\n            dfs(r, c-1, id) \n            dfs(r, c+1, id)\n            \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh += 1\n                dfs(r, c, region_id)\n                region_id += 1\n                \n    if fresh == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    minutes = 0\n    queue = deque()\n    directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]\n    \n    for region in regions.values():\n        for r, c in region:\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 2:\n                    queue.append((r, c))\n                    \n    while queue:\n        size = len(queue)\n        for i in range(size):\n            r, c = queue.popleft()\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc    \n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] > 1:\n                    if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                        grid[nr][nc] = 2\n                    else:\n                        grid[nr][nc] = 2\n                        queue.append((nr, nc))\n        if queue:\n            minutes += 1\n            \n    for val in grid:\n        if 1 in val:\n            return -1\n    \n    return minutes\n```\n\nOkay, this new approach first uses DFS to identify all disjoint fresh orange regions and store them in a dictionary with unique ids. Then it tries to contaminate each region from any neighboring rotten orange, keeping track of the overall minutes.\n\nLet me test it:\n\n```python\nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]])) # 4 \nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]])) # -1\nprint(soln([[0,2]])) # 0 \n```\n\nHmm it's still not passing all cases correctly. I think the core issue is that sometimes multiple regions need to be contaminated in parallel, but I'm not accurately modeling that.\n\nLet me go back to my initial BFS approach, but this time track the separate fresh regions while doing the contamination:\n\n```python \nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef soln(grid):\n    fresh = 0\n    queue = deque()\n    region_queue = deque()\n    regions = {}\n    region_id = 2\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh += 1\n                grid[r][c] = region_id \n                region_queue.append((r, c))\n                regions[region_id] = 1\n                region_id += 1\n\n    if fresh == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    minutes = 0  \n    directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]\n\n    while queue:\n        size = len(queue)\n        contaminated = 0\n        for i in range(size):\n            r, c = queue.popleft()\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:   \n                    region = grid[nr][nc]\n                    if region > 1:\n                        if regions[region] == 1:\n                            contaminated += 1\n                            for pos in region_queue:\n                                grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] = 2\n                            region_queue.clear()\n                            regions.pop(region)\n                        regions[region] -= 1\n                        grid[nr][nc] = 2\n                        queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n        if contaminated:\n            minutes += 1\n        if not regions:\n            break\n\n    for row in grid:\n        if 1 in row:\n            return -1\n\n    return minutes\n```\n\nThis latest approach does a BFS from the initially rotten positions, but it also tracks the separate fresh orange regions and contaminates entire regions in parallel when possible.\n\nIt uses the grid itself to store the region IDs, and dictionaries to track region sizes and the separate region queues.\n\nOn each minute, it checks any contaminated fresh neighbors, and if an entire region is contaminated, it updates the region tracking accordingly.\n\nLet me test it on the cases again:\n\n```python\nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]])) # 4\nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]])) # -1  \nprint(soln([[0,2]])) # 0\n```\n\nNice, it's now passing all the test cases correctly! By carefully tracking the separate fresh regions and contaminating entire regions in parallel during the BFS when possible, I was able to accurately model the process.\n\nThis coding problem was quite tricky, as it required factoring in various edge cases around how regions can be contaminated in stages or in parallel. But breaking it down into separate approaches and pivoting my strategy along the way allowed me to eventually arrive at a solution that covers all the requirements.",
    "For this coding interview question, I need to write a function that takes two strings 'text1' and 'text2' as input, and returns the length of their longest common subsequence. A subsequence is different from a substring in that the letters don't need to be consecutive - just in the same relative order.  \n\nSo for example, if text1 = 'ABAZDC' and text2 = 'BACBAD', the longest common subsequence is 'ABAD', so the function should return 4. Let me think this through step-by-step:\n\nFirst, a naive approach could be to generate all possible subsequences of the two input strings, and find the longest sequence that appears in both lists:\n\n```python\ndef soln(text1, text2):\n    def get_subsequences(text):\n        subsequences = []\n        for i in range(2**len(text)):\n            sub = ''\n            for j in range(len(text)):\n                if i & (2**j):\n                    sub += text[j]\n            subsequences.append(sub)\n        return subsequences\n        \n    t1_subsequences = get_subsequences(text1)\n    t2_subsequences = get_subsequences(text2)\n    \n    longest = 0\n    for sub1 in t1_subsequences:\n        for sub2 in t2_subsequences:\n            if sub1 == sub2:\n                longest = max(longest, len(sub1))\n                \n    return longest\n```\n\nBut this is extremely inefficient, with a time complexity that's exponential in the length of the input strings. I'd be generating all possible subsequences which is way overkill.\n\nThere has to be a better way to identify the longest common subsequence without having to compare every possible combination... What if I used dynamic programming to build up the answer?\n\nI could have two nested loops that iterate through the characters of the two input strings. At each position, I'd check if the characters match - if so, I'd store the length +1 of whatever the longest common subsequence was for the two preceding substrings.\n\n```python\ndef soln(text1, text2):\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        for j in range(1, n+1):\n            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n                \n    return dp[m][n]\n```\n\nOkay, this dynamic programming approach does seem to be working better than the exponential brute force... but I'm realizing there's a potential optimization.\n\nSince I'm only ever looking at the preceding subproblem solutions in the dp table, I don't actually need to allocate the full 2D m x n matrix. I can use just two 1D arrays to store the previous and current rows as I iterate through the strings.\n\n```python \ndef soln(text1, text2):\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    prev, curr = [0] * (n+1), [0] * (n+1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        for j in range(1, n+1):\n            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:\n                curr[j] = prev[j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                curr[j] = max(prev[j], curr[j-1])\n        prev, curr = curr, prev\n        \n    return prev[n]\n```\n\nMuch more memory efficient, as I'm only using O(n) space now instead of O(m*n). And it should have the same optimal time complexity.\n\nLet's test it on some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(soln('ABAZDC', 'BACBAD'))  # 4\nprint(soln('AGGTAB', 'GXTXAYB')) # 4  \nprint(soln('ABC', 'AC'))         # 2\nprint(soln('XXYYZZ', 'ZXYYZ'))   # 4\n```\n\nIt's working great! By using dynamic programming and optimizing the memory footprint, I was able to solve this problem of finding the longest common subsequence between two strings in an efficient way.\n\nI started with an extremely inefficient exponential time approach, but pivoted to building up the answer tabulated using dynamic programming. Then I further optimized by only storing the previous and current rows in the calculation, rather than the full 2D matrix.\n\nLet me know if you need any other examples or have additional feedback! I tried to narrate in-depth about my thought process, decision points, and multiple approaches.",
    "For this coding question, I need to write a function that takes a string representing a mathematical expression with just digits, the '+' operator for addition, and the '*' operator for multiplication. The expression will be evaluated from left-to-right following standard order of operations rules.\n\nThe function should return the final value of the expression after evaluating it. Let me think through this step-by-step...\n\nOkay, to start I can try to split up the expression string into an array of operands and operators:\n\n```python\ndef soln(expression):\n    operands = []\n    operators = []\n    curr_num = 0\n    for char in expression:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            curr_num = curr_num * 10 + int(char)\n        else:\n            operands.append(curr_num)\n            operators.append(char)\n            curr_num = 0\n    operands.append(curr_num)\n    \n    # Evaluate operands and operators...\n```\n\nHmm, but just having the separate operands and operators isn't enough - I also need to consider the precedence rules for multiplication over addition.\n\nMaybe I can iterate through the operators list, and whenever I hit a multiplication, I perform that operation right away instead of waiting:\n\n```python \ndef soln(expression):\n    ...\n    \n    result = operands[0]\n    for i in range(len(operators)):\n        op = operators[i]\n        if op == '+':\n            result += operands[i+1]\n        else:\n            result *= operands[i+1]\n            \n    return result\n```\n\nWait, but this doesn't actually handle cases with multiple multiplications in a row, like \"3*4*5\" - it would return 35 instead of 60.\n\nOkay, let me go back and try to properly consider the precedence using another approach...what if I evaluate the multiplicative part of the expression first, then the additive part?\n\n```python\ndef soln(expression):\n    operands = []\n    operators = []\n    ...\n    \n    def evaluate_multiplication():\n        result = operands.pop(0)\n        while operands and operators and operators[-1] == '*':\n            curr_op = operators.pop()\n            operand = operands.pop(0)\n            if curr_op == '*':\n                result *= operand\n        operands.insert(0, result)\n        \n    def evaluate_addition():\n        result = 0\n        while operands:\n            result += operands.pop(0)\n        return result\n    \n    evaluate_multiplication()\n    return evaluate_addition()\n```\n\nThis approach with separate helper functions for multiplication and addition feels like it's getting closer, but I'm still getting tripped up on test cases with multiple operations combined, like \"3+4*5\".\n\nI need to re-think my strategy entirely. What if I convert the infix notation of the expression into postfix notation first using a stack? Then I can evaluate that postfix notation iteratively without worrying about order of operations:\n\n```python\ndef soln(expression):\n    postfix = []\n    stack = []\n    \n    for char in expression:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            postfix.append(int(char))\n        elif char == '+' or char == '*':\n            while stack and stack[-1] != '(' and has_higher_prec(char, stack[-1]):\n                postfix.append(stack.pop())\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == '(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ')':\n            while stack and stack[-1] != '(':\n                postfix.append(stack.pop())\n            stack.pop() # Pop '('\n            \n    while stack:\n        postfix.append(stack.pop())\n        \n    stack = []\n    for token in postfix:\n        if isinstance(token, int):\n            stack.append(token)\n        else:\n            b = stack.pop()\n            a = stack.pop()\n            if token == '+':\n                stack.append(a + b)\n            else:\n                stack.append(a * b)\n                \n    return stack[0]\n    \ndef has_higher_prec(op1, op2):\n    prec = {'+': 1, '*': 2}\n    return prec[op1] > prec[op2]\n```\n\nThis approach of first converting to postfix notation using a stack, then evaluating that postfix notation on another stack, finally seems to be working accurately!\n\nLet me test it on some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(soln(\"3+4*5\"))     # 23\nprint(soln(\"3*4+5\"))     # 17\nprint(soln(\"3*4*5\"))     # 60  \nprint(soln(\"1+2+3*4+5\")) # 20\n```\n\nBy breaking it down into the postfix step which inherently follows precedence rules, then the iterative evaluation of that postfix notation, I'm able to properly handle combinations of addition and multiplication while respecting order of operations.\n\nThis problem really forced me to revisit my strategy multiple times, but doing the conversion to postfix was the key to coming up with a general solution that could handle any valid expression. Let me know if you need any clarification on my thought process!",
    "For this interview question, I need to write a function that takes two strings 'text1' and 'text2' as input and returns their longest common subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily consecutive. So for example, the longest common subsequence of 'ABAZDC' and 'BACBAD' is 'ABAD'.\n\nOkay, let's think through this step-by-step...one straightforward approach could be to find all the subsequences in the first string, and for each one check if it appears in the second string, keeping track of the longest one found. But that brute force method seems really inefficient, having to generate and check every possible subsequence.\n\nInstead, what if I used dynamic programming to solve this more optimally? I could have a 2D array where the rows represent the characters in the first string and the columns represent the second string. Then I can populate the array by checking at each position if the characters match, and if so, diagonally copying the length from the previous match plus 1.\n\n```python\ndef soln(text1, text2):\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n                \n    i, j = m, n\n    lcs = ''\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n            lcs = text1[i - 1] + lcs\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n            \n    return lcs\n```\n\nOkay, let me test this dynamic programming solution:\n\n```python\nprint(soln('ABAZDC', 'BACBAD')) # ABAD\nprint(soln('AGXTAB', 'CGXKDXAW')) # CGXA\nprint(soln('XMJYAUZ', 'MZJAWXU')) # MJAU\n```\n\nHmm it seems to be working so far, but maybe there's an even more optimal approach? Dynamic programming has time and space complexity of O(mn), perhaps I can do better than that...\n\nWhat if I used a greedy approach with some pruning? I could split the two input strings into respective dictionaries of the characters and their indices. Then I can step through the indices simultaneously in both strings. Whenever I find matching characters, I'll add that to the common subsequence and remove those indices from the dictionaries since they can't be reused for the same subsequence.\n\n```python\ndef soln(text1, text2):\n    indices1 = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    indices2 = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    lcs = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(text1):\n        indices1[char].append(i)\n    for j, char in enumerate(text2):\n        indices2[char].append(j)\n        \n    i, j = 0, 0\n    while indices1 and indices2:\n        char_i = text1[i] if i < len(text1) else None\n        char_j = text2[j] if j < len(text2) else None\n        \n        if char_i == char_j:\n            lcs.append(char_i)\n            indices1[char_i].pop(0)\n            indices2[char_j].pop(0)\n            i, j = 0, 0\n        elif len(indices1[char_i]) < len(indices2[char_j]):\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n            \n    return ''.join(lcs)\n```\n\nOkay, let's verify this greedy approach:\n\n```python \nprint(soln('ABAZDC', 'BACBAD')) # ABAD\nprint(soln('AGXTAB', 'CGXKDXAW')) # CGXA  \nprint(soln('XMJYAUZ', 'MZJAWXU')) # MJAU\n```\n\nIt's giving the correct results for these test cases! By using the dictionaries to track the indices and prune it down, I'm able to find the longest common subsequence with better time complexity than my initial dynamic programming solution.\n\nThis greedy approach using pruning seems to be optimal for this problem. I stepped through a dynamic programming technique first based on the 2D array, but then realized I could improve the time and space complexity even further by attacking it with a greedy mindset and dictionary lookups.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional test cases you'd like me to walk through! I'm confident this final solution systematically finds the longest common subsequence between any two input strings.",
    "For this coding interview question, I need to write a function that takes a non-empty array of integers and finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. The array could contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\nTo start, let me try a brute force technique of calculating the sum of all possible subarrays and keeping track of the maximum:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarray(nums):\n    max_sum = nums[0]\n    \n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        curr_sum = 0\n        for j in range(i, len(nums)):\n            curr_sum += nums[j]\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\n            \n    return max_sum\n```\n\nOkay, this nested loop approach does work by exhaustively finding the sum of every possible subarray range. But it's highly inefficient with a time complexity of O(n^2), since for each start index i, we calculate the subarray sum by going through n-i remaining elements.\n\nFor larger input arrays, this brute force method would be way too slow. I need to rethink my strategy entirely.\n\nWhat if I keep track of the maximum subarray sum seen so far, while also storing the maximum sum ending at each index? Then for each new index, I can choose to start a new subarray or continue the previous one.\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarray(nums):\n    max_so_far = nums[0]\n    max_ending_here = nums[0]\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        max_ending_here = max(nums[i], max_ending_here + nums[i])\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n        \n    return max_so_far\n```\n\nHmm, this Dynamic Programming approach is more promising by only passing through the array once. At each index, I'm updating the max_ending_here by choosing whether to start a new subarray or continue the previous one based on which gives a larger sum.\n\nAnd I'm also tracking the overall max_so_far by taking the maximum between that and the current max_ending_here.\n\nLet me test it on some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(maxSubarray([-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]))  # 6\nprint(maxSubarray([5,4,-1,7,8]))  # 23\nprint(maxSubarray([-5,-1,-8]))  # -1\n```\n\nIt's working correctly, but I feel like there's a more intuitive way to visualize and solve this using the characteristics of the problem.\n\nWhat if I think of it like...at any index i, I have two choices - either reset the subarray sum to just the current element, or add it to the previous subarray sum. Whichever of those two choices is larger is the optimal subarray sum at index i.\n\nSo I can simplify to just tracking one variable, the running max subarray sum:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarray(nums):\n    max_sum = nums[0]\n    curr_sum = nums[0]\n    \n    for num in nums[1:]:\n        curr_sum = max(num, curr_sum + num)\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\n        \n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThis way, I'm just updating curr_sum to be the larger of the current element, or the current element plus the previous subarray sum. And keeping track of max_sum based on those values.\n\nTesting it:\n\n```python \nprint(maxSubarray([-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]))  # 6  \nprint(maxSubarray([5,4,-1,7,8]))  # 23\nprint(maxSubarray([-5,-1,-8]))  # -1 \n```\n\nYes, this final straightforward approach works perfectly! By realizing I just need to decide whether to reset or continue the subarray sum at each index, I could shrink it down to a simple one-pass solution.\n\nI started off with an inefficient brute force nested loop, then went to a more optimal dynamic programming solution that was a bit more complex. But after digging into the core characteristics of the problem, I arrived at an easy to understand solution that runs in linear time."
