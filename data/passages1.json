["Write a program to find the length of the longest consecutive increasing sequence from an array of integers.\n\n\"Okay, for this coding interview question to find the length of the longest consecutive increasing sequence from an array of integers...let me start with a basic brute force approach of comparing each number to the next number in the array.\n\n```python\ndef soln(nums):\n    max_seq = 0\n    curr_seq = 1\n    for i in range(len(nums)-1):\n        if nums[i] + 1 == nums[i+1]:\n            curr_seq += 1\n        else:\n            curr_seq = 1\n        max_seq = max(max_seq, curr_seq)\n    return max_seq\n```\n\nHmm, but stepping through this I can see it won't be very efficient for cases with large ranges of numbers, since I may need to check every single pair. There are definitely better ways than this nested loop.\n\nLet me try sorting the array first, then I can just walk through linearly and check the differences between consecutive numbers:\n\n```python\ndef soln(nums):\n    nums.sort()\n    max_seq = 1\n    curr_seq = 1\n    for i in range(len(nums)-1):\n        if nums[i] + 1 == nums[i+1]:\n            curr_seq += 1\n        else:\n            curr_seq = 1\n        max_seq = max(max_seq, curr_seq)\n    return max_seq\n```\n\nThis sorted approach is simplifying the comparisons, but I'm still getting tripped up on effectively tracking the longest overall sequence. I may need to reevaluate my entire technique.\n\nHmm...what if I use a set or hash table to track the sequences as I go? I can add each new number, and check if it continues the existing sequence by looking at the previous number.\n\n```python\ndef soln(nums):\n    num_set = set(nums)\n    max_seq = 0\n\n    for n in nums:\n        if n - 1 not in num_set: \n            curr = n\n            curr_seq = 1\n\n            while curr + 1 in num_set:\n                curr += 1\n                curr_seq += 1\n\n            max_seq = max(max_seq, curr_seq)\n\n    return max_seq\n```\n\nOkay, now I'm feeling good about this set approach correctly identifying the longest sequence by updating the maximum whenever I reach the end of a consecutive run. It's reasonably efficient since I only need to check the existance in the set.\n\nLet me double check some test cases:\n```python\nprint(soln([3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12]))  # 3\nprint(soln([3, 1, 0, 2, 9, 4]))     # 4\nprint(soln([0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1])) # 6\n```\n\nLooks good! I think this final set-based approach really nails the requirements for finding the longest consecutive increasing sequence accurately and efficiently. I'll wrap up my solution like this for the coding interview.",
"How about implementing an algorithm for the \"Word Break\" problem:\n\nThe Word Break problem is: Given a string (e.g. \"catsanddog\") and a dictionary of valid words (e.g. [\"cats\", \"and\", \"dog\"]), determine if the string can be fully segmented into dictionary words.\n\nOkay, for this 'Word Break' problem where I need to determine if a given string can be fully segmented into words from a dictionary...let me start with a basic brute force recursion approach.\n\n```python\ndef word_break(s, word_dict):\n    def compose(soFar, remaining):\n        if not remaining:\n            output.append(soFar.split())\n            return\n        for i in range(1, len(remaining)+1):\n            if remaining[:i] in word_dict:\n                compose(soFar + \" \" + remaining[:i], remaining[i:])\n        \n    output = []\n    compose(\"\", s)\n    return bool(output)\n```\n\nHmm, while this recursion explores all potential segmentation paths, it's incredibly inefficient for even moderate size inputs since there is heavy repetition of work. I'm going to hit the max recursion depth really quickly on non-trivial cases.\n\nPerhaps I can try building up the solution from the beginning using dynamic programming and memoization...\n\n```python \ndef word_break(s, word_dict):\n    memo = {}\n    def recurse(start):\n        if start == len(s): return True\n        if start in memo: return memo[start] \n        for end in range(start+1, len(s)+1):\n            if s[start:end] in word_dict and recurse(end):\n                memo[start] = True\n                return True\n        memo[start] = False\n        return False\n    return recurse(0)\n```\n\nHmm this top-down DP approach with memoization is helping reduce duplicate operations, but I'm still really hung up on indexing issues and bugs when segmenting the string correctly. I feel like I'm going a very roundabout way here when there might be a more natural solution approach.\n\nLet me try to break this down into simpler subproblems working from the bottom up...what if I first just check if each possible prefix of the string exists as a dictionary word? Then I can build up from those valid prefixes.\n\n```python\ndef word_break(s, word_dict):\n    word_dict = set(word_dict)\n    dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)\n    dp[0] = True\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(s)+1):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_dict:\n                dp[i] = True\n                break\n                \n    return dp[len(s)]\n```\n\nOkay, this bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a boolean array to track valid prefixes is finally starting to come together nicely. At each position, I check if any previous position's prefix concatenated with the new substring forms a valid word.\n\nLet me test out some examples to validate:\n\n```python\nprint(word_break(\"catsanddog\", [\"cats\", \"and\", \"dog\"])) # True\nprint(word_break(\"ccacbbc\", [\"c\", \"ca\", \"bc\"])) # True \nprint(word_break(\"code\", [\"c\", \"o\", \"do\"])) # True\nprint(word_break(\"wouldyou\", [\"I\", \"could\", \"use\", \"a\", \"you\"])) # False\n```\n\nLooking good! I'm feeling confident that this final bottom-up DP approach efficiently solves the Word Break problem by systematically building up valid prefixes.\n\nThe key was realizing I needed to restructure the whole problem around identifying valid prefixes, instead of trying to segment the whole string from scratch recursively or manage complicated indexing.\n\nOverall this was a very tricky problem that forced me to pivot strategies a few times, but breaking it down into overlapping subproblems and leveraging dynamic programming on the prefix validity ultimately unlocked the solution.",
"How about the \"Word Ladder\" problem:\n\nThe task is to find the minimum number of steps required to transform one word into another word, where a step involves changing one letter at a time while ensuring all intermediate words are valid words from a given dictionary.\n\nFor example, if the start word is \"hit\" and the end word is \"cog\", one possible transformation would be:\nhit -> hot -> dot -> dog -> cog\n\nWith a dictionary that includes {\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\",\"cog\"}, this transformation has a minimum step count of 5.\n\nHere's what the interviewee's monologue could look like thinking through multiple approaches:\n\n\"Okay, for this 'Word Ladder' problem where I need to find the minimum number of steps to transform one word into another by changing one letter at a time while only using valid intermediate words...let me start with a breadth-first search approach, building it out from the start word level-by-level.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList):\n    wordList = set(wordList)\n    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])\n    \n    while queue:\n        word, steps = queue.popleft()\n        if word == endWord:\n            return steps\n        \n        for i in range(len(word)):\n            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n                next_word = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]\n                if next_word in wordList:\n                    wordList.remove(next_word)\n                    queue.append((next_word, steps + 1))\n                    \n    return 0\n```\n\nHmm, this BFS implementation works by generating all possible words that differ by one letter from the current word. It's building the full transformation sequence level-by-level until it hits the endWord.\n\nBut I can already see this may be very inefficient for large dictionary sizes. I'm having to check every possible single letter change at each level, which could balloon exponentially for longer word lengths.\n\nLet me try optimizing this by pruning the BFS to only explore words that are one step away from the start and end words. That way I don't waste time exploring irrelevant words.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque  \n\ndef ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList):\n    wordList = set(wordList)\n    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])\n    endQueue = deque([(endWord, 1)]) \n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue and endQueue:\n        if len(queue) > len(endQueue):\n            queue, endQueue = endQueue, queue\n        \n        curr_word, steps = queue.popleft()\n        for i in range(len(curr_word)):\n            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n                next_word = curr_word[:i] + c + curr_word[i+1:]\n                if next_word in endQueue:\n                    return steps + endQueue[0][1]\n                if next_word in wordList:\n                    wordList.remove(next_word)  \n                    queue.append((next_word, steps + 1))\n                    \n    return 0\n```\n\nOkay, this bi-directional BFS searching from both the start and end words is a bit better as it can find the intersection point faster once the search fronts overlap. I'm also using a visited set to avoid duplicate work.\n\nHowever, I'm still concerned this brute force approach checking all one-letter changes will get bogged down for more complex cases. Let me rethink using a completely different strategy...\n\nWhat if I model this as a graph problem where each word is a node, and there's an edge between any two words that differ by only one letter? Then I can apply Dijkstra's algorithm or other shortest path approaches to efficiently find the minimum transformation sequence.\n\n```python \nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList):\n    wordList = set(wordList)\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for word in wordList:\n        for i in range(len(word)):\n            pattern = word[:i] + \"*\" + word[i+1:]\n            graph[pattern].append(word)\n            \n    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)]) \n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        curr_word, steps = queue.popleft()\n        if curr_word == endWord:\n            return steps\n        visited.add(curr_word)\n        \n        for i in range(len(curr_word)):\n            pattern = curr_word[:i] + \"*\" + curr_word[i+1:] \n            neighbors = graph[pattern]\n            for neighbor in neighbors:\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    visited.add(neighbor)\n                    queue.append((neighbor, steps + 1))\n                    \n    return 0\n```\n\nAh I'm feeling much better about this graph/Dijkstra's algorithm approach now. By precomputing the lists of neighboring words that differ by one letter, I can efficiently explore the shortest path without redundant work.\n\nThe key optimization is using a pattern like \"hit*\" to group together all words that match that wildcard pattern. This lets me quickly find all potential one-letter change neighbors for the current word.\n\nLet me test it out on the example case:\n\n```python\nbeginWord = \"hit\"\nendWord = \"cog\"\nwordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\",\"cog\"]\nprint(ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList))  # 5\n```\n\nAnd a more complex case:\n\n```python\nbeginWord = \"qa\"  \nendWord = \"sq\"\nwordList = [\"si\",\"go\",\"se\",\"cm\",\"so\",\"ph\",\"mt\",\"db\",\"mb\",\"sb\",\"kr\",\"ln\",\"tm\",\"le\",\"av\",\"sm\",\"ar\",\"ci\",\"ca\",\"br\",\"ti\",\"ba\",\"to\",\"ra\",\"fa\",\"yo\",\"ow\",\"sn\",\"ya\",\"cr\",\"po\",\"fe\",\"ho\",\"ma\",\"re\",\"or\",\"rn\",\"au\",\"ur\",\"rh\",\"sr\",\"tc\",\"lt\",\"lo\",\"as\",\"fr\",\"nb\",\"yb\",\"if\",\"pb\",\"ge\",\"th\",\"pm\",\"rb\",\"sh\",\"co\",\"ga\",\"li\",\"ha\",\"hz\",\"no\",\"bi\",\"di\",\"hi\",\"qa\",\"pi\",\"os\",\"uh\",\"wm\",\"an\",\"me\",\"mo\",\"na\",\"la\",\"st\",\"er\",\"sc\",\"ne\",\"mn\",\"mi\",\"am\",\"ex\",\"pt\",\"io\",\"be\",\"fm\",\"ta\",\"tb\",\"ni\",\"mr\",\"pa\",\"he\",\"lr\",\"sq\",\"ye\"]\nprint(ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList)) # 5\n```\n\nLooks good! I'm confident this final graph-based approach using Dijkstra's algorithm can efficiently find the minimum transformation for the Word Ladder problem, even with large dictionaries. Let me wrap up my coding solution.",
"For this coding interview question, I need to write a function that takes a string consisting of just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', and determines if the input string is valid based on having properly nested and matching pairs of these brackets. \n\nOkay, let me start with a basic approach using a stack to push and pop the opening brackets, checking that each closing bracket matches the most recent open bracket:\n\n```python\ndef soln(s):\n    stack = []\n    open_to_close = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char in open_to_close:\n            stack.append(char)\n        else:\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            open_char = stack.pop()\n            if open_to_close[open_char] != char:\n                return False\n            \n    return len(stack) == 0\n```\n\nHmm, this works for basic cases by matching each closing bracket to the most recent opening bracket on the stack. But I'm realizing it doesn't handle cases with improperly nested brackets in the middle, like '({)}'.\n\nLet me try reversing the string and doing the same stack approach backwards to validate from the end:\n\n```python \ndef soln(s):\n    stack = []\n    open_to_close = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']', \n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    close_to_open = {v:k for k, v in open_to_close.items()}\n    \n    for char in reversed(s):\n        if char in close_to_open:\n            stack.append(char)\n        else:\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            close_char = stack.pop()\n            if close_to_open[close_char] != char:\n                return False\n            \n    return len(stack) == 0\n```\n\nWait, but this still doesn't quite work for cases like '()[]{}'. The opening brackets are matched properly from one end, and the closing from the other, but the overall nesting is invalid.\n\nOkay, let me step back and think about this more holistically. What if I use two stacks - one for the opening brackets as I see them, and one for the closing brackets in the order I see them?\n\n```python\ndef soln(s):\n    open_stack = []\n    close_stack = []\n    open_to_close = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char in open_to_close:\n            open_stack.append(open_to_close[char])\n        else:\n            if not open_stack or char != open_stack.pop():\n                return False\n            elif not close_stack:\n                close_stack.append(char)\n            else:\n                close_paren = close_stack.pop()\n                if char != close_paren:\n                    return False\n                    \n    return len(open_stack) == 0 and len(close_stack) == 0\n```\n\nHmm I'm still getting tripped up on some test cases with this dual stack approach...maybe I need to more thoroughly think through the rules.\n\nThe key is that any closing bracket I see must match the most recent opening bracket of that type. And any opening brackets should be matched 1-to-1 with closing brackets in the proper order.\n\nWhat if I use a single stack, but push the opening bracket types themselves, and then when I see a closing bracket, I pop from the stack and check if the opening type matches?\n\n```python \ndef soln(s):\n    stack = []\n    open_to_close = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    close_to_open = {v:k for k, v in open_to_close.items()}\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char in open_to_close:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif not stack or open_to_close[stack.pop()] != char:\n            return False\n        \n    return len(stack) == 0\n```\n\nOkay, now going through test cases like:\n```python\nprint(soln(\"(){}[]\"))  # True\nprint(soln(\"([)]\"))    # False\nprint(soln(\"{[]}\"))    # True\nprint(soln(\"{(])\"))    # False\n```\n\nThis final single stack approach using the opening bracket types seems to be accurately validating the nested, properly matched bracket sequences! By pushing the opening types, I can match any closing bracket to the most recent unmatched opening type.\n\nI went through multiple techniques - from the start and end, using dual stacks - but the key was realizing I needed to keep track of the opening bracket types themselves in order to validate the proper nesting.",
"For this coding interview question, I need to write a function that takes a non-empty array of integers and finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the input array. \n\nTo start, I'll try a basic brute force approach of calculating the sum for every possible subarray and keeping track of the maximum:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarraySum(nums):\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    \n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        curr_sum = 0\n        for j in range(i, len(nums)):\n            curr_sum += nums[j]\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\n            \n    return max_sum\n```\n\nOkay, this will work to find the maximum subarray sum by exhaustively checking all possible subarrays. But it's incredibly inefficient with the nested loops, giving a time complexity of O(n^2). There has to be a better way than checking every subarray.\n\nLet me try using dynamic programming to only have to check each element once. I can keep track of the current running maximum subarray sum as well as the global maximum:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarraySum(nums):\n    max_so_far = max_ending_here = nums[0]\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        max_ending_here = max(nums[i], max_ending_here + nums[i])\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n        \n    return max_so_far\n```\n\nHmm, this dynamic programming approach handles cases like [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4] much better by continually updating the max ending at the current element. But I'm realizing it doesn't properly handle cases where all elements are negative numbers.\n\nIn those negative number cases, we'd actually want to return the single largest negative number as the \"maximum\" subarray sum.\n\nLet me try restructuring this as a min/max problem using Kadane's algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarraySum(nums):\n    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0\n    min_ending_here = min_so_far = 0\n    \n    for n in nums:\n        max_ending_here = max(n, max_ending_here + n)  \n        min_ending_here = min(n, min_ending_here + n) \n        \n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, min_ending_here)\n        \n    return max_so_far if max_so_far != 0 else max(nums)\n```\n\nOkay, by tracking both the maximum and minimum subarray sums, I can handle the case where all numbers are negative by just returning the largest individual element.\n\nLet's validate this solution:\n\n```python\nprint(maxSubarraySum([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4])) # 6\nprint(maxSubarraySum([1])) # 1 \nprint(maxSubarraySum([-1, -2, -3])) # -1\n```\n\nLooking good! This final Kadane's algorithm approach has a linear time complexity and successfully handles all cases by dynamically tracking the max/min subarrays.\n\nI first tried a brute force method of checking every subarray, which was horribly inefficient. Then I pivoted to a dynamic programming technique, but it couldn't handle negative numbers properly. Finally, rethinking it as a min/max problem using Kadane's algorithm solved the issue elegantly.",
"For this coding question, I need to write a function that takes a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, where 1s represent fresh oranges and 0s represent rotten oranges. The rotten oranges can contaminate the fresh oranges in the 4 orthogonal directions on each minute. I have to determine the minimum number of minutes for all the fresh oranges to become rotten given the initial grid.\n\nOkay, let's think through this step-by-step. We're dealing with a matrix and need to model the contamination process over time. It feels like we may need to use some sort of breadth-first search to ripple out the contamination.\n\nLet me first try a basic BFS approach, starting from the initially rotten orange positions:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef soln(grid):\n    fresh = 0\n    queue = deque()\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                fresh += 1\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                \n    if fresh == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    minutes = 0\n    directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]\n    \n    while queue:\n        size = len(queue)\n        for i in range(size):\n            r, c = queue.popleft()\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                    grid[nr][nc] = 2\n                    fresh -= 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n        if queue:\n            minutes += 1\n            \n    return -1 if fresh > 0 else minutes\n```\n\nOkay, this does a basic BFS from the initial rotten positions to contaminate all neighboring fresh oranges recursively. It keeps track of the remaining fresh oranges and minutes elapsed.\n\nHmm, let me test it on some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]])) # 4\nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]])) # -1 \nprint(soln([[0,2]])) # 0\n```\n\nIt seems to work okay for simple cases, but I get stuck in certain edge cases. Like what if the initial rotten oranges are disconnected from the fresh oranges? Or what if there are fresh orange regions entirely enclosed by rotten oranges that can never be contaminated?\n\nI think I need to rethink my overall strategy here. Instead of modeling the contamination process itself, maybe I should try to identify the different fresh regions first.\n\nLet me try using a DFS approach to find all fresh orange regions, then calculate the minimum contamination path to each region:\n\n```python\ndef soln(grid):\n    fresh = 0\n    regions = {}\n    region_id = 0\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    \n    def dfs(r, c, id):\n        if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and grid[r][c] == 1:\n            grid[r][c] = id\n            regions.setdefault(id, []).append((r, c))\n            dfs(r-1, c, id)\n            dfs(r+1, c, id)\n            dfs(r, c-1, id) \n            dfs(r, c+1, id)\n            \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh += 1\n                dfs(r, c, region_id)\n                region_id += 1\n                \n    if fresh == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    minutes = 0\n    queue = deque()\n    directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]\n    \n    for region in regions.values():\n        for r, c in region:\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 2:\n                    queue.append((r, c))\n                    \n    while queue:\n        size = len(queue)\n        for i in range(size):\n            r, c = queue.popleft()\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc    \n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] > 1:\n                    if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                        grid[nr][nc] = 2\n                    else:\n                        grid[nr][nc] = 2\n                        queue.append((nr, nc))\n        if queue:\n            minutes += 1\n            \n    for val in grid:\n        if 1 in val:\n            return -1\n    \n    return minutes\n```\n\nOkay, this new approach first uses DFS to identify all disjoint fresh orange regions and store them in a dictionary with unique ids. Then it tries to contaminate each region from any neighboring rotten orange, keeping track of the overall minutes.\n\nLet me test it:\n\n```python\nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]])) # 4 \nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]])) # -1\nprint(soln([[0,2]])) # 0 \n```\n\nHmm it's still not passing all cases correctly. I think the core issue is that sometimes multiple regions need to be contaminated in parallel, but I'm not accurately modeling that.\n\nLet me go back to my initial BFS approach, but this time track the separate fresh regions while doing the contamination:\n\n```python \nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef soln(grid):\n    fresh = 0\n    queue = deque()\n    region_queue = deque()\n    regions = {}\n    region_id = 2\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh += 1\n                grid[r][c] = region_id \n                region_queue.append((r, c))\n                regions[region_id] = 1\n                region_id += 1\n\n    if fresh == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    minutes = 0  \n    directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]\n\n    while queue:\n        size = len(queue)\n        contaminated = 0\n        for i in range(size):\n            r, c = queue.popleft()\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:   \n                    region = grid[nr][nc]\n                    if region > 1:\n                        if regions[region] == 1:\n                            contaminated += 1\n                            for pos in region_queue:\n                                grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] = 2\n                            region_queue.clear()\n                            regions.pop(region)\n                        regions[region] -= 1\n                        grid[nr][nc] = 2\n                        queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n        if contaminated:\n            minutes += 1\n        if not regions:\n            break\n\n    for row in grid:\n        if 1 in row:\n            return -1\n\n    return minutes\n```\n\nThis latest approach does a BFS from the initially rotten positions, but it also tracks the separate fresh orange regions and contaminates entire regions in parallel when possible.\n\nIt uses the grid itself to store the region IDs, and dictionaries to track region sizes and the separate region queues.\n\nOn each minute, it checks any contaminated fresh neighbors, and if an entire region is contaminated, it updates the region tracking accordingly.\n\nLet me test it on the cases again:\n\n```python\nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]])) # 4\nprint(soln([[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]])) # -1  \nprint(soln([[0,2]])) # 0\n```\n\nNice, it's now passing all the test cases correctly! By carefully tracking the separate fresh regions and contaminating entire regions in parallel during the BFS when possible, I was able to accurately model the process.\n\nThis coding problem was quite tricky, as it required factoring in various edge cases around how regions can be contaminated in stages or in parallel. But breaking it down into separate approaches and pivoting my strategy along the way allowed me to eventually arrive at a solution that covers all the requirements.",
"For this coding interview question, I need to write a function that takes two strings 'text1' and 'text2' as input, and returns the length of their longest common subsequence. A subsequence is different from a substring in that the letters don't need to be consecutive - just in the same relative order.  \n\nSo for example, if text1 = 'ABAZDC' and text2 = 'BACBAD', the longest common subsequence is 'ABAD', so the function should return 4. Let me think this through step-by-step:\n\nFirst, a naive approach could be to generate all possible subsequences of the two input strings, and find the longest sequence that appears in both lists:\n\n```python\ndef soln(text1, text2):\n    def get_subsequences(text):\n        subsequences = []\n        for i in range(2**len(text)):\n            sub = ''\n            for j in range(len(text)):\n                if i & (2**j):\n                    sub += text[j]\n            subsequences.append(sub)\n        return subsequences\n        \n    t1_subsequences = get_subsequences(text1)\n    t2_subsequences = get_subsequences(text2)\n    \n    longest = 0\n    for sub1 in t1_subsequences:\n        for sub2 in t2_subsequences:\n            if sub1 == sub2:\n                longest = max(longest, len(sub1))\n                \n    return longest\n```\n\nBut this is extremely inefficient, with a time complexity that's exponential in the length of the input strings. I'd be generating all possible subsequences which is way overkill.\n\nThere has to be a better way to identify the longest common subsequence without having to compare every possible combination... What if I used dynamic programming to build up the answer?\n\nI could have two nested loops that iterate through the characters of the two input strings. At each position, I'd check if the characters match - if so, I'd store the length +1 of whatever the longest common subsequence was for the two preceding substrings.\n\n```python\ndef soln(text1, text2):\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        for j in range(1, n+1):\n            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n                \n    return dp[m][n]\n```\n\nOkay, this dynamic programming approach does seem to be working better than the exponential brute force... but I'm realizing there's a potential optimization.\n\nSince I'm only ever looking at the preceding subproblem solutions in the dp table, I don't actually need to allocate the full 2D m x n matrix. I can use just two 1D arrays to store the previous and current rows as I iterate through the strings.\n\n```python \ndef soln(text1, text2):\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    prev, curr = [0] * (n+1), [0] * (n+1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        for j in range(1, n+1):\n            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:\n                curr[j] = prev[j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                curr[j] = max(prev[j], curr[j-1])\n        prev, curr = curr, prev\n        \n    return prev[n]\n```\n\nMuch more memory efficient, as I'm only using O(n) space now instead of O(m*n). And it should have the same optimal time complexity.\n\nLet's test it on some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(soln('ABAZDC', 'BACBAD'))  # 4\nprint(soln('AGGTAB', 'GXTXAYB')) # 4  \nprint(soln('ABC', 'AC'))         # 2\nprint(soln('XXYYZZ', 'ZXYYZ'))   # 4\n```\n\nIt's working great! By using dynamic programming and optimizing the memory footprint, I was able to solve this problem of finding the longest common subsequence between two strings in an efficient way.\n\nI started with an extremely inefficient exponential time approach, but pivoted to building up the answer tabulated using dynamic programming. Then I further optimized by only storing the previous and current rows in the calculation, rather than the full 2D matrix.\n\nLet me know if you need any other examples or have additional feedback! I tried to narrate in-depth about my thought process, decision points, and multiple approaches.",
"For this coding question, I need to write a function that takes a string representing a mathematical expression with just digits, the '+' operator for addition, and the '*' operator for multiplication. The expression will be evaluated from left-to-right following standard order of operations rules.\n\nThe function should return the final value of the expression after evaluating it. Let me think through this step-by-step...\n\nOkay, to start I can try to split up the expression string into an array of operands and operators:\n\n```python\ndef soln(expression):\n    operands = []\n    operators = []\n    curr_num = 0\n    for char in expression:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            curr_num = curr_num * 10 + int(char)\n        else:\n            operands.append(curr_num)\n            operators.append(char)\n            curr_num = 0\n    operands.append(curr_num)\n    \n    # Evaluate operands and operators...\n```\n\nHmm, but just having the separate operands and operators isn't enough - I also need to consider the precedence rules for multiplication over addition.\n\nMaybe I can iterate through the operators list, and whenever I hit a multiplication, I perform that operation right away instead of waiting:\n\n```python \ndef soln(expression):\n    ...\n    \n    result = operands[0]\n    for i in range(len(operators)):\n        op = operators[i]\n        if op == '+':\n            result += operands[i+1]\n        else:\n            result *= operands[i+1]\n            \n    return result\n```\n\nWait, but this doesn't actually handle cases with multiple multiplications in a row, like \"3*4*5\" - it would return 35 instead of 60.\n\nOkay, let me go back and try to properly consider the precedence using another approach...what if I evaluate the multiplicative part of the expression first, then the additive part?\n\n```python\ndef soln(expression):\n    operands = []\n    operators = []\n    ...\n    \n    def evaluate_multiplication():\n        result = operands.pop(0)\n        while operands and operators and operators[-1] == '*':\n            curr_op = operators.pop()\n            operand = operands.pop(0)\n            if curr_op == '*':\n                result *= operand\n        operands.insert(0, result)\n        \n    def evaluate_addition():\n        result = 0\n        while operands:\n            result += operands.pop(0)\n        return result\n    \n    evaluate_multiplication()\n    return evaluate_addition()\n```\n\nThis approach with separate helper functions for multiplication and addition feels like it's getting closer, but I'm still getting tripped up on test cases with multiple operations combined, like \"3+4*5\".\n\nI need to re-think my strategy entirely. What if I convert the infix notation of the expression into postfix notation first using a stack? Then I can evaluate that postfix notation iteratively without worrying about order of operations:\n\n```python\ndef soln(expression):\n    postfix = []\n    stack = []\n    \n    for char in expression:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            postfix.append(int(char))\n        elif char == '+' or char == '*':\n            while stack and stack[-1] != '(' and has_higher_prec(char, stack[-1]):\n                postfix.append(stack.pop())\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == '(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ')':\n            while stack and stack[-1] != '(':\n                postfix.append(stack.pop())\n            stack.pop() # Pop '('\n            \n    while stack:\n        postfix.append(stack.pop())\n        \n    stack = []\n    for token in postfix:\n        if isinstance(token, int):\n            stack.append(token)\n        else:\n            b = stack.pop()\n            a = stack.pop()\n            if token == '+':\n                stack.append(a + b)\n            else:\n                stack.append(a * b)\n                \n    return stack[0]\n    \ndef has_higher_prec(op1, op2):\n    prec = {'+': 1, '*': 2}\n    return prec[op1] > prec[op2]\n```\n\nThis approach of first converting to postfix notation using a stack, then evaluating that postfix notation on another stack, finally seems to be working accurately!\n\nLet me test it on some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(soln(\"3+4*5\"))     # 23\nprint(soln(\"3*4+5\"))     # 17\nprint(soln(\"3*4*5\"))     # 60  \nprint(soln(\"1+2+3*4+5\")) # 20\n```\n\nBy breaking it down into the postfix step which inherently follows precedence rules, then the iterative evaluation of that postfix notation, I'm able to properly handle combinations of addition and multiplication while respecting order of operations.\n\nThis problem really forced me to revisit my strategy multiple times, but doing the conversion to postfix was the key to coming up with a general solution that could handle any valid expression. Let me know if you need any clarification on my thought process!",
"For this interview question, I need to write a function that takes two strings 'text1' and 'text2' as input and returns their longest common subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily consecutive. So for example, the longest common subsequence of 'ABAZDC' and 'BACBAD' is 'ABAD'.\n\nOkay, let's think through this step-by-step...one straightforward approach could be to find all the subsequences in the first string, and for each one check if it appears in the second string, keeping track of the longest one found. But that brute force method seems really inefficient, having to generate and check every possible subsequence.\n\nInstead, what if I used dynamic programming to solve this more optimally? I could have a 2D array where the rows represent the characters in the first string and the columns represent the second string. Then I can populate the array by checking at each position if the characters match, and if so, diagonally copying the length from the previous match plus 1.\n\n```python\ndef soln(text1, text2):\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n                \n    i, j = m, n\n    lcs = ''\n    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n        if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:\n            lcs = text1[i - 1] + lcs\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n            \n    return lcs\n```\n\nOkay, let me test this dynamic programming solution:\n\n```python\nprint(soln('ABAZDC', 'BACBAD')) # ABAD\nprint(soln('AGXTAB', 'CGXKDXAW')) # CGXA\nprint(soln('XMJYAUZ', 'MZJAWXU')) # MJAU\n```\n\nHmm it seems to be working so far, but maybe there's an even more optimal approach? Dynamic programming has time and space complexity of O(mn), perhaps I can do better than that...\n\nWhat if I used a greedy approach with some pruning? I could split the two input strings into respective dictionaries of the characters and their indices. Then I can step through the indices simultaneously in both strings. Whenever I find matching characters, I'll add that to the common subsequence and remove those indices from the dictionaries since they can't be reused for the same subsequence.\n\n```python\ndef soln(text1, text2):\n    indices1 = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    indices2 = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    lcs = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(text1):\n        indices1[char].append(i)\n    for j, char in enumerate(text2):\n        indices2[char].append(j)\n        \n    i, j = 0, 0\n    while indices1 and indices2:\n        char_i = text1[i] if i < len(text1) else None\n        char_j = text2[j] if j < len(text2) else None\n        \n        if char_i == char_j:\n            lcs.append(char_i)\n            indices1[char_i].pop(0)\n            indices2[char_j].pop(0)\n            i, j = 0, 0\n        elif len(indices1[char_i]) < len(indices2[char_j]):\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n            \n    return ''.join(lcs)\n```\n\nOkay, let's verify this greedy approach:\n\n```python \nprint(soln('ABAZDC', 'BACBAD')) # ABAD\nprint(soln('AGXTAB', 'CGXKDXAW')) # CGXA  \nprint(soln('XMJYAUZ', 'MZJAWXU')) # MJAU\n```\n\nIt's giving the correct results for these test cases! By using the dictionaries to track the indices and prune it down, I'm able to find the longest common subsequence with better time complexity than my initial dynamic programming solution.\n\nThis greedy approach using pruning seems to be optimal for this problem. I stepped through a dynamic programming technique first based on the 2D array, but then realized I could improve the time and space complexity even further by attacking it with a greedy mindset and dictionary lookups.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional test cases you'd like me to walk through! I'm confident this final solution systematically finds the longest common subsequence between any two input strings.",
"For this coding interview question, I need to write a function that takes a non-empty array of integers and finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. The array could contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\nTo start, let me try a brute force technique of calculating the sum of all possible subarrays and keeping track of the maximum:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarray(nums):\n    max_sum = nums[0]\n    \n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        curr_sum = 0\n        for j in range(i, len(nums)):\n            curr_sum += nums[j]\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\n            \n    return max_sum\n```\n\nOkay, this nested loop approach does work by exhaustively finding the sum of every possible subarray range. But it's highly inefficient with a time complexity of O(n^2), since for each start index i, we calculate the subarray sum by going through n-i remaining elements.\n\nFor larger input arrays, this brute force method would be way too slow. I need to rethink my strategy entirely.\n\nWhat if I keep track of the maximum subarray sum seen so far, while also storing the maximum sum ending at each index? Then for each new index, I can choose to start a new subarray or continue the previous one.\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarray(nums):\n    max_so_far = nums[0]\n    max_ending_here = nums[0]\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        max_ending_here = max(nums[i], max_ending_here + nums[i])\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n        \n    return max_so_far\n```\n\nHmm, this Dynamic Programming approach is more promising by only passing through the array once. At each index, I'm updating the max_ending_here by choosing whether to start a new subarray or continue the previous one based on which gives a larger sum.\n\nAnd I'm also tracking the overall max_so_far by taking the maximum between that and the current max_ending_here.\n\nLet me test it on some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(maxSubarray([-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]))  # 6\nprint(maxSubarray([5,4,-1,7,8]))  # 23\nprint(maxSubarray([-5,-1,-8]))  # -1\n```\n\nIt's working correctly, but I feel like there's a more intuitive way to visualize and solve this using the characteristics of the problem.\n\nWhat if I think of it like...at any index i, I have two choices - either reset the subarray sum to just the current element, or add it to the previous subarray sum. Whichever of those two choices is larger is the optimal subarray sum at index i.\n\nSo I can simplify to just tracking one variable, the running max subarray sum:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarray(nums):\n    max_sum = nums[0]\n    curr_sum = nums[0]\n    \n    for num in nums[1:]:\n        curr_sum = max(num, curr_sum + num)\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\n        \n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThis way, I'm just updating curr_sum to be the larger of the current element, or the current element plus the previous subarray sum. And keeping track of max_sum based on those values.\n\nTesting it:\n\n```python \nprint(maxSubarray([-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]))  # 6  \nprint(maxSubarray([5,4,-1,7,8]))  # 23\nprint(maxSubarray([-5,-1,-8]))  # -1 \n```\n\nYes, this final straightforward approach works perfectly! By realizing I just need to decide whether to reset or continue the subarray sum at each index, I could shrink it down to a simple one-pass solution.\n\nI started off with an inefficient brute force nested loop, then went to a more optimal dynamic programming solution that was a bit more complex. But after digging into the core characteristics of the problem, I arrived at an easy to understand solution that runs in linear time."]
