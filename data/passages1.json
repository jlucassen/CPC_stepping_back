["For this problem, I need to prove that for any integer n greater than 1, if n is not a perfect square, then there exists some integer m such that m^2 < n < (m+1)^2.  \n\nLet me try a proof by mathematical induction:\n\nBase case: For n = 2, we can take m = 1. Then 1^2 < 2 < 2^2, so the statement holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume the statement is true for some integer k >= 2. We want to show it is also true for k+1.\nOkay, so k+1 is not a perfect square since k is not a perfect square. Because if k was m^2 for some m, then (m+1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 = k + 2m + 1 = k+1, which would mean k+1 is a perfect square, contradicting the premise.\n\nSince k is not a perfect square, by the inductive hypothesis, there exists some integer m such that m^2 < k < (m+1)^2. \n\nNow I need to find a way to show that there exists an integer m' such that (m')^2 < k+1 < (m'+1)^2...\nHmm. Well, let's see. Since m^2 < k, adding 1 to both sides gives m^2 + 1 < k + 1. But I can't easily relate that to (m')^2 in a clean way.\n\nMaybe if I worked backwards from (m+1)^2? No, that's not helping me isolate the m' value I need.\n\nLet me try a different approach - since k+1 is not a perfect square, there is no integer p such that p^2 = k+1. So k+1 must be between two perfect square values...but how do I determine what those values are in relation to the m value for k?\n\nDang, I've gotten myself turned around in a loop trying to relate m' to m and k in a way that maintains the inductive chain. This is incredibly messy and I'm struggling to find a coherent way to nicely prove the step for k+1 using the inductive hypothesis about k.\n\nOkay, I need to take a step back because I'm just going around in circles with this induction approach. It clearly isn't clicking intuitively for me on how to cleanly transition from the statement being true for k to being true for k+1 in a succinct way. I've spent too much time struggling to try to force this induction framework.\n\nLet me scrap it entirely and reframe my thinking from the ground up. Induction is a powerful technique, but it's clearly not the right tool for this particular proof about squared values and integerness. Maybe I need to restructure from first principles...\n\nIf n is not a perfect square, that means the square root of n is irrational. Which implies there is no integer m such that m^2 = n. However, we can still use the floor and ceiling functions to bound n between two consecutive perfect square integers that sandwich the irrational square root value...\n\nOkay, here's a much cleaner proof starting from the characterization of n not being a perfect square:\n\n1) Assume n > 1 is not a perfect square\n2) Then sqrt(n) is irrational  \n3) Let m = floor(sqrt(n)), which is the greatest integer <= sqrt(n)\n4) Since sqrt(n) > m, we have m^2 < n  \n5) Let m+1 be the least integer > sqrt(n)\n6) Since sqrt(n) < m+1, we have n < (m+1)^2\n7) Therefore, m^2 < n < (m+1)^2\n\nThis approach flows so much more cleanly by first establishing what it means for n to not be a perfect square, and then using basic properties of floor, ceiling, and inequalities to construct the m values that sandwich n.\n\nI'm quite relieved I decided to completely change tactics instead of stubbornly trying to force an induction proof. That was leaving me hopelessly tangled up. Whereas this reframed square root approach is elegant and generalizes perfectly.\n\nTesting it on examples:\n- For n = 5, m = 2 and 2^2 < 5 < 3^2  \n- For n = 20, m = 4 and 4^2 < 20 < 5^2\n\nLet me know if any part of this proof needs clarification! I'm glad I was able to talk through that pivotal moment of realizing I was spinning my wheels on an unproductive path, and needing to start fresh from a new perspective.",
"Hmm, I need to prove this statement about prime numbers:\n\n'For any prime number p greater than 3, p is of the form 6n +/- 1 for some integer n.'\n\nOkay, let me start by trying to prove this directly using the definition of prime numbers.\n\nSuppose p is prime and p > 3. By the definition of a prime number, p is only divisible by 1 and itself...\n\n*Several lines of working*\n\nNo, this isn't going anywhere. I'm getting bogged down in messy arithmetic. There has to be a cleaner approach.\n\nMaybe I can look at this from a different angle - think about the possible remainder when dividing p by 6. Since p > 3, it can't be divisible by 2 or 3, so the possible remainders are 1, 5, -1, or -5 upon dividing by 6.\n\n*Scribbles some examples*\n\nAha! I'm seeing a pattern here. The primes I'm getting are always of the form 6n +/- 1. For example:\n5 = 6(0) + 5 \n7 = 6(1) + 1\n11 = 6(1) + 5\n13 = 6(2) - 1\n\nSo what I need to show is that any prime p > 3 cannot leave a remainder of 2, 3, or 4 when divided by 6. Okay, let's try proving that by contradiction...\n\nSuppose p leaves a remainder of 2 or 4 upon dividing by 6. Then p = 6n + 2 or p = 6n + 4 for some integer n.\n\nIn both cases, p is divisible by 2, which contradicts p being prime since primes > 3 cannot be divisible by 2.\n\nSimilarly, if p leaves a remainder of 3 upon dividing by 6, then p = 6n + 3. This implies p is divisible by 3, which also contradicts p being prime.\n\nTherefore, through contradiction, we've shown that any prime p > 3 cannot leave a remainder of 2, 3, or 4 upon dividing by 6.\n\nCombining this with the pattern I observed earlier, this means any prime p > 3 must be of the form 6n +/- 1, proving the original statement!\n\n*Writes out the complete proof steps neatly*\n\nWhew, that felt like quite the journey, but breaking it down into smaller pieces and looking at it from multiple angles helped get me to the solution. Proofs can be very tricky, but immensely satisfying when you finally crack them.",
"Okay, the statement I need to prove is: \n\n'The sum of the angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees.'\n\nLet me first try to visualize this and see if any intuitive approaches come to mind.\n\n*Draws a few quadrilateral examples*\n\nHmm, I can't really 'see' why the sum would always be 360 degrees just by looking at the shapes. The quadrilaterals can take on so many different formations.\n\nMaybe I can try to prove this by breaking it down into smaller pieces...\n\nSuppose I have some arbitrary quadrilateral ABCD. If I construct a diagonal AC that splits it into two triangles ABC and ACD:\n\n*Draws diagram*\n\nFor any triangle, I know the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees by the Triangle Sum Theorem.\n\nSo for ΔABC, the sum of its angles is 180 degrees.\nAnd for ΔACD, the sum of its angles is also 180 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the angles in the original quadrilateral ABCD is:\n180 (for ΔABC) + 180 (for ΔACD) = 360 degrees\n\nAh but wait, in adding up the angles this way, I've double counted the angle at A, and also the one at C where the two triangles overlap.\n\nSo I need to subtract those two overlapping angles from the total:\n360 - A - C = Sum of angles in the quadrilateral\n\nHmm, but I don't know what A and C are. This approach still doesn't prove it for all possible quadrilaterals.\n\nOkay, let me go back to the beginning and try a different tactic...\n\n*Starts over*\n\nInstead of splitting it into triangles, let me try rearranging the quadrilateral in a clever way.\n\nIf I take ABCD, and create a new shape by drawing lines from one vertex to a point on the opposite side, I can split it into two pairs of triangles:\n\n*Draws diagram*\n\nSo I've broken the quadrilateral into ΔABE and ΔCDE, with a overlapping ΔBCE in the middle.\n\nFor ΔABE and ΔCDE, each has a sum of angles of 180 degrees.\nAnd for ΔBCE, it has a sum of angles of 180 degrees.  \n\nTherefore, in total, the sum is:\n180 + 180 + 180 = 540 degrees\n\nBut again, I've double counted some angles where the triangles overlap. The angles at B, C, and E are each counted twice.\n\nSo I need to subtract out these overlapping angles from the total:\n540 - B - C - E = Sum of angles in quadrilateral\n\nThis time, since B + C + E must equal 180 degrees (they form ΔBCE), I can substitute:\n540 - 180 = 360 degrees\n\nYes! By cleverly rearranging the quadrilateral, I was able to show that its sum of angles must be 360 degrees for any possible quadrilateral.\n\nWhew, that was a tricky one. The key was looking at it from multiple perspectives and not getting stuck in any one unfruitful approach. Breaking it down, rearranging, and using known results about triangles ultimately led me to the solution.",
"I need to prove the following statement:\n\n'The sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n^2.'\n\nLet me first try a direct proof by induction on n. \n\nBase Case (n=1):  \nThe first odd positive integer is 1. \n1^2 = 1, so the statement holds for n=1.\n\nInductive Step: Assume the statement holds for some k >= 1, that is, the sum of the first k odd positive integers is k^2. Now consider k+1:\n\nSum of the first k+1 odd positive integers \n= Sum of the first k odd positive integers + the (k+1)th odd positive integer\n= k^2 + (2k+1)    [Using the inductive hypothesis, and the (k+1)th odd is 2k+1]\n= k^2 + 2k + 1\n= (k+1)^2\n\nSo if the statement holds for k, it also holds for k+1, completing the induction.\n\n*Pauses to review*\n\nHmm, something doesn't seem quite right. The arithmetic worked out, but I have a nagging feeling this proof isn't airtight. \n\nLet me try a different approach - maybe a visualization will help. I'll list out the first few odd positive integers and their partial sums:\n\n1 \n1 + 3 = 4\n1 + 3 + 5 = 9  \n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16\n...\n\nI'm noticing that the sum of the first n odd integers always takes the form of a square number! And the pattern is, the nth odd number is (2n-1).\n\nSo the sum of the first n odd integers is:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) \n\nIf I can show that this sum is equal to n^2, that will prove the statement.\n\nLet's try this:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) \n= [1 + (2n-1)] + [2 + (2n-2)] + ... + [n + n]\n= 2n + 2(n-1) + 2(n-2) + ... + 2(1)\n= 2n(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)\n\nNow I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which states that the sum from 1 to n is (n(n+1))/2.\n\nSubstituting this in:\n2n(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 2n * (n(n+1))/2 \n                     = n^2(n+1)\n                     = n^2 + n^2 \n                     = n^2\n\nYes! By breaking it down step-by-step and finding the right visualization, I was able to complete the proof.\n\n*Writes the complete proof neatly*\n\nBreaking it into smaller pieces and trying multiple approaches was crucial. Mathematical proofs really require working through all the intuition and potential dead-ends before finding that elegant solution.",
"Okay, the statement I need to prove is:\n\n'The sum of the angles of any convex polygon with n sides is (n - 2) * 180 degrees.'\n\nTo start, I should try to gather some basic intuition about this problem. Let me draw out a few polygons and visualize the angles:\n\n*Draws a triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon*\n\nHmm, looking at these examples, it does seem like the total angle sum is related to the number of sides. The more sides, the larger the total angle sum.\n\nBut how can I formalize this into an actual proof? I need to find a way to represent the angle sum algebraically in terms of n.\n\nOne approach could be to break each polygon down into triangles. That might allow me to relate the total angle sum to the sum of the angles in multiple triangles which is 180 degrees.\n\n*Sketches breaking a quadrilateral into two triangles*\n\nOkay, let's try building up the proof from this approach of dissecting into triangles:\n\nLet the number of sides of the polygon be n. \nTo break this polygon into triangles, I need to draw (n - 2) lines from one vertex to the remaining vertices.\n\nSo the polygon gets divided into (n - 2) triangles.\nIn each triangle, the angle sum is 180 degrees.\nTherefore, the total angle sum for the (n - 2) triangles is: (n - 2) * 180 degrees.\n\nSince these (n - 2) triangles completely make up the original n-sided polygon, without double counting any angles, the total angle sum for the polygon is also (n - 2) * 180 degrees!\n\nTo solidify the proof, let me verify this algebraically by induction on n:\n\nBase case: For n = 3 (a triangle)\nNumber of triangles formed = 3 - 2 = 1\nAngle sum = 1 * 180 = 180 degrees \nWhich is correct, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180.\n\nInductive step: Assume the formula holds for some n = k\nThat is, the total angle sum for a k-gon is (k - 2) * 180 degrees\n\nNow, consider a (k + 1)-gon\nThis is formed by adding one more side to the original k-gon\nWhich means one more triangle is formed \nSo the (k + 1)-gon is made up of (k - 2 + 1) = (k - 1) triangles\n\nUsing the inductive hypothesis, the angle sum of the original k triangles is: \n(k - 2) * 180 degrees\n\nAnd the angle sum of the new additional triangle is 180 degrees\n\nSo the total angle sum of the (k + 1)-gon = [(k - 2) * 180] + 180\n                                         = (k - 1) * 180 degrees\n\nHence, the formula holds for the (k + 1) case as well! By the principle of induction, this proves the formula is true for any n-gon.\n\nPhew, breaking it down into cases, using triangles as a building block, and validating with induction allowed me to finally construct this proof. Mathematical proofs can definitely require trying multiple approaches before finding one that works!",
"Okay, let me read the statement to prove:\n\n'The sum of the cubes of any three consecutive natural numbers is divisible by 9.'\n\nHmm...this seems like it could involve some algebraic manipulation.

But how can I show this is divisible by 9 for any value of n?\n\n*Thinks for a bit*\n\nYou know what, let me put this polynominal into a different form, taking out a factor of n^2:\n3n^3 + 9n^2 + 15n + 9 \n= 3n^2(n + 3) + 9(n + 2)\n\nNow I'm seeing something! The term (n + 3) is always divisible by 3 since n is an integer. \n\nAnd (n + 2) is one less than a multiple of 3, so it can be written as 3k - 1 for some integer k.\n\nSubstituting this in:\n3n^2(n + 3) + 9(3k - 1)\n= 3n^2(n + 3) + 27k - 9\n= 9(n^2(n + 3) + 3k - 1)\n\nSo the entire expression is equal to 9 times something!\n\nThis proves that for any natural number n, the sum of the cubes of the three consecutive numbers n, n+1, n+2 is divisible by 9!\n\n*Writes out full proof steps*\n\nPhew, that was a fun little algebraic proof.

Let's see...that's n^3 repeated (2n - n + 1) = n times.

"Okay, this is the statement I need to prove:\n\n'For any integer n greater than 1, if n is not a perfect square, then there exists a unique pair of consecutive odd numbers whose product is n.'\n\nThis seems like it could get fairly intricate with several cases to consider. But I'll take it step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let me try to rephrase and reframe the statement in a way that feels more approachable:\n\nI need to show that for any integer n > 1 that is not a square number, I can always find two odd integers a and b with a + 2 = b, such that a * b = n.

If n cannot be written as a product of two odd numbers, then it must be able to be written as 2^k * m for some integers k >= 1 and odd m >= 1.\n\nWhy? Well, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, n's prime factorization contains only powers of 2 (2^k) and an odd number m.\n\nBut this implies n is a perfect square! Since m is odd, m = (2i+1) for some i. Then:\n\nn = 2^k * m \n   = 2^k * (2i+1)\n   = (2^(k+i))^2\n\nSo n is a perfect square, which contradicts the initial assumption that n is not a square number.\n\nThrough this contradiction, I've shown that for any n > 1 that is not a square, n must be able to be written as a product of two odd numbers a and b.\n\nBy a similar line of reasoning, since a and b are consecutives odds, we get that a*b is odd, so this representation is unique.\n\nWhew, that was quite involved!
