In this case, we can see that all the numbers are multiples of 1, so we can keep the equation as it is:\n\n25x^2 - 550x + 1008 = 0\n\nTo factor it further, we try to express the middle term (i.e. -550x) as a sum of two terms such that their product is equal to the product of the first term (25x^2) and the last term (1008).\n\nFor that, we will need to break down 1008 and 25 into their factors and try different combinations.\n\nBy factoring, we see that 1008 = 36*28 and 25 = 5*5. We can see that (36*5) + (28*5) = 550x\n\nSo we can write equation as:\n\n25x^2 - (180x + 140x) + 1008 = 0\n\nNow, rearranging them, we have:\n\n25x^2 - 180x - 140x + 1008 = 0\n\n5x(5x - 36) - 28(5x - 36) = 0\n\nNow, re-writing the above into factored form, we have:\n\n(5x - 28)(5x  - 36) = 0\n\nThus, solving for x gives the roots of the equation as:\n\nx = 28/5 = 5.6\n\nand\n\nx = 36/5 = 7.2\n\nTherefore, the roots of the equation 25x^2 - 550x + 1008 = 0 are 5.6 and 7.2."}
