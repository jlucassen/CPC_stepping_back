{"equation": "4x^2 - 20x + 24 = 0\n", "context": "Start by simplifying the equation. Each coefficient is divisible by 4, so divide each side by 4:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\nNow, try to factor. Look for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. The numbers -2 and -3 fit these conditions, so break up -5x:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 3x + 6 = 0\n\nNow, re-group:\n\nx(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0\n\nFactor out the common factor, which is (x - 2) here:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nTherefore, the roots of the equation are 2 and 3, which can be found by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for x:\n\nIf x - 2 = 0, then x = 2\nIf x - 3 = 0, then x = 3\n\nSo, our roots are 2 and 3."}
{"equation": "3x^2 - 6x + 3 = 0\n", "context": "This quadratic equation can be factored. We start by factoring out the greatest common factor, which is 3, from each term:\n\n3x^2 - 6x + 3 = 0 becomes x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\n\nWe need to find two numbers that multiply to +1 and add to -2. Those numbers are -1 and -1. So we can factorize the quadratic equation as\n\n(x - 1)^2 = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the roots of the equation:\n\nx - 1 = 0  =>  x = 1\n\nSo the equation has one distinct root, x = 1."}
