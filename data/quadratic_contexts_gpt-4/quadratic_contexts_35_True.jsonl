{"equation": "6x^2 - 150x + 924 = 0\n", "context": "First, the equation can be simplified by dividing through by 6 giving:\n\nx^2 - 25x + 154 = 0\n\nNow let's try to factor it:\n\nThe goal is to find two numbers that add to -25 and multiply to 154.\n\nTo find these two numbers, it's helpful to break down 154 into prime factors. When we do this, we see that 154 can be written as a product of 2, 7, and 11.\n\nHowever, none of these combinations of 2, 7, and 11 will add up to -25. Therefore, we can't factorize the equation.\n\nSince the quadratic equation cannot be factored, we must use the quadratic formula which is x = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ] / 2a. In our equation, a = 1, b = -25, c = 154.\n\nLet's substitute these values into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [ 25 \u00b1 sqrt((-25)^2 - 4*1*154) ] / 2\nx = [ 25 \u00b1 sqrt(625 - 616) ] / 2\nx = [ 25 \u00b1 sqrt(9) ] / 2\nx = [ 25 \u00b1 3 ] / 2\n\nTherefore, the two roots are:\nx = 28/2 = 14 and x = 22/2 = 11."}
{"equation": "14x^2 - 504x + 1792 = 0\n", "context": "To solve the quadratic equation 14x^2 - 504x + 1792 = 0, we can start by factoring out a common factor from each term. In this case, the common factor is 14. \n\nSo let's factor that out: \n\n14(x^2 - 36x + 128) = 0.\n\nNow we have a simpler quadratic simplified equation of x^2 - 36x + 128 that we need to factor. For this, we look for two numbers whose product is 128 and whose sum is -36. By inspection, we can use -32 and -4, because (-32)*(-4) = 128 and -32 + (-4) = -36. So we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n14(x - 32)(x - 4) = 0\n\nNow apply the zero product property, which states that if ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 32 = 0   or   x - 4 = 0\n\nSolving for x gives:\n\nx = 32  or  x = 4\n\nSo, the roots of the given equation are x = 32 and x = 4."}
