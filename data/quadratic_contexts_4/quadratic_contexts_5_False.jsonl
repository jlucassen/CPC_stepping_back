We can simplify the equation to make factoring easier. \n\nDividing the entire equation by 2 gives us: \n\nx^2 - 6x + 10 = 0\n\nNow, we need two numbers that when multiplied together give you 10 and when added together give you -6. There are no such numbers.\n\nSWITCHING\n\nSince the equation isn't easily factored, we will switch to the Quadratic Formula:\n\nx = [-(-6) \u00b1 sqrt((-6)^2 - 4*1*10)] / (2 * 1)\n\nSo, \n\nx = [6 \u00b1 sqrt(36 - 40)] / 2\n\nAs root of negative number is complex, the solutions for x are complex numbers. \n\nx = 3 \u00b1 sqrt(-4) / 2\n\nSo the solutions are:\n\nx = 3 \u00b1 i*sqrt(4) / 2\n\nTherefore:\n\nx = 3 \u00b1 2*i\n\nSo, the roots of the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 12x + 20 = 0 are:\n\nx = 3 + 2i and x = 3 - 2i"}
{"equation": "4x^2 - 32x + 68 = 0\n", "context": "The quadratic equation is already in standard form (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), and it's coefficients are a=4, b=-32, c=68.\n\nSince the quadratic does not seem to be factoring easily, I will use the Quadratic Formula:\n\nSWITCHING\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nSubstance the values of a,b, and c into the formula we get:\n\nx = [32 \u00b1 sqrt((-32)^2 - 4*4*68)] / (2*4)\nx = [32 \u00b1 sqrt(1024 - 1088)] / 8\nx = [32 \u00b1 sqrt(-64)] / 8\n\nSince the discriminant is negative (b^2 - 4ac = -64 < 0), the roots of the quadratic equation will be complex numbers.\n\nSo, the roots of the equation are:\n\nx = [32 \u00b1 sqrt(-64)] / 8 = [32 \u00b1 8i] / 8 = 4 \u00b1 i. \n\nTherefore, the roots of the quadratic equation 4x^2 - 32x + 68 = 0 are \nx = 4 + i and x = 4 - i."}
{"equation": "2x^2 - 18x + 45 = 0\n", "context": "To find the roots of a quadratic equation, we typically try to first factorize the given equation. In this case, the equation is 2x^2 - 18x + 45 = 0. By dividing every term by the coefficient of x^2, which is 2, we get:\n\nx^2 - 9x + 22.5 = 0.\n\nThis cannot be factorized easily, so we have to switch to the quadratic formula to solve it.\n\nSWITCHING\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are the coefficients of x^2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\nHere, a = 1, b = -9, and c = 22.5.\n\nUsing these values in the quadratic formula gives:\n\nx = [9 \u00b1 sqrt((-9)^2 - 4*1*22.5)] / 2*1,\n\n= [9 \u00b1 sqrt(81 - 90)] / 2,\n\n= [9 \u00b1 sqrt(-9)] / 2.\n\nThe term inside the square root is negative, indicating that the roots of the equation are complex numbers.
