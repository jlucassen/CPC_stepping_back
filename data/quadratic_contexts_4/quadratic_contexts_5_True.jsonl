But it might be simpler to use the quadratic formula right away considering the coefficients are greater than one. So we say, SWITCHING.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ] / (2a) \n\nIn our equation, a = 5, b = -30, and c = 25.\n\nSubstituting the values in the formula, we get:\n\nx = [ 30 \u00b1 sqrt((-30)^2 - 4*5*25) ] / (2*5)\nx = [ 30 \u00b1 sqrt(900 - 500) ] / 10\nx = [ 30 \u00b1 sqrt(400) ] / 10\nx = [ 30 \u00b1 20 ] / 10\nx = [ 50 / 10 ] or [ 10 / 10 ]\n\nTherefore, the roots of the equation 5x^2 - 30x + 25 = 0 are x = 5 or x = 1."}
{"equation": "3x^2 - 6x + 3 = 0\n", "context": "The given equation is already in the standard form of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 3, b = -6 and c = 3.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, we can solve for x.\n\nSWITCHING\n\nHere b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4*3*3 = 36 - 36 = 0.\n\nSo, x = [-(-6) \u00b1 sqrt(0)] / 2*3\n\n=> x = [6 \u00b1 0] / 6\n\n=> x = 1.\n\nThis implies that the quadratic equation has repeated roots and the roots are x1 = 1 and x2 = 1."}
{"equation": "4x^2 - 20x + 24 = 0\n", "context": "First, to make the equation easier to solve, we factor out the common factor of 4 from each term:\n\n4(x^2 - 5x + 6) = 0\n\nBecause the factor of 4 can never be 0, we can ignore it from now on:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\nTo find the roots of the quadratics, we will use factoring. First, we need to find two numbers which satisfy that their product equals 6 (the third term) and their sum equals -5 (the coefficient of x).\n\nThe numbers -2 and -3 satisfy both conditions since (-2)*(-3) = 6 and -2 + -3 = -5. We use these numbers to split the middle term:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 3x + 6 = 0\n\nRewriting this as two mini trinomials:\n\nx(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0\n\nThen factor by grouping:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nThis gives us that x = 2,3 are the roots of the quadratic equation."}
