The factors of 1862 are 1, 2, 19, 31, 38, 62, 589, and 1862.\n\nAfter examining the factors, we can see that this equation cannot be easily factored. Therefore, we need to SWITCH to using the quadratic formula to find the roots.\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where the equation is in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.\n\nFor our equation, a = 14, b = -364, and c = 1862. Plug these values into the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (364 \u00b1 \u221a((-364)^2 - 4*14*1862)) / (2*14)\nx = (364 \u00b1 \u221a(132496 - 104104)) / 28\nx = (364 \u00b1 \u221a28392) / 28\nx = (364 \u00b1 168.5) / 28\n\nNow we can find the two roots:\n\nx1 = (364 + 168.5) / 28 = 532.5 / 28 \u2248 19.017\nx2 = (364 - 168.5) / 28 = 195.5 / 28 \u2248 6.982\n\nTherefore, the roots of the quadratic equation 14x^2 - 364x + 1862 = 0 are approximately x \u2248 19.017 and x \u2248 6.982."}
