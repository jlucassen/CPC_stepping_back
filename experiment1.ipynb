      "\n",
      "1. The current approach involves using a set to keep track of the numbers in the array.\n",
      "2. It then iterates through the array, for each number it checks if the previous number (current number - 1) is not in the set.\n",
      "3. If the previous number is not in the set, it starts a new consecutive increasing sequence from that number.\n",
      "4. It then loops through the set to find the longest consecutive increasing sequence and updates the maximum sequence length accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's evaluate the approach further:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pros**:\n",
      "   - The use of a set allows for quick lookups and makes it easier to determine if the next number is in the sequence.\n",
      "   - The approach is efficient as it iterates through the array only once and then through the set for potential sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cons**:\n",
      "   - This approach may not correctly handle cases where the array contains duplicates.\n",
      "   - If the array is very large, storing all numbers in a set may consume a lot of memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these points, I would say that the current approach is mostly on the right track for finding the length of the longest consecutive increasing sequence. It is efficient and provides a reasonable solution to the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my recommendation would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "**No, I recommend staying with the current approach**. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you encounter any specific issues with the current approach or if you have any concerns, we can reevaluate and consider a different approach based on that feedback.\n",
