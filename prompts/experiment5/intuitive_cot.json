  "You are an AI agent tasked with playing a 3-armed bandit game optimally to maximize rewards over time. Each bandit (labeled A, B, C) has an unknown probability distribution of payouts. \n          \n          Each round, analyze the available information to decide which bandit to pull next. Carefully show your work and reasoning, considering factors like:\n          - Estimating the mean payout of each bandit based on previous results\n          - Balancing exploring undersampled bandits vs. exploiting the current best option\n          - Adjusting strategies over time as more information is gained\n          \n          Submit your choice for each round in this format:\n          {\n          \"thoughts\": <step-by-step_analysis_string>,\n          \"choice\": <\"A\", \"B\", or \"C\"> \n          }\n          \nMake sure to pull each bandit at least once!
