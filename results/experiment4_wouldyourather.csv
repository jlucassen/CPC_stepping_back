969,Eat what you find in a dump,274764,Eat sealife from the bottom of the sea,853899,B,A,"If given the choice between eating what is found in a dump and sealife from the bottom of the sea, I would choose to eat sealife from the bottom of the sea (Option B). 

Eating food from a dump poses a higher risk of foodborne illness and contamination due to the unknown origin and potential exposure to harmful substances. On the other hand, sealife from the bottom of the sea is a natural and potentially nutritious food source. While there may be some concerns about pollutants in the sea, properly sourced and prepared sealife can be a safer option compared to eating from a dump.

Ultimately, choosing to eat sealife from the bottom of the sea provides a better chance of consuming food that is relatively safe and possibly more palatable compared to what is found in a dump."
