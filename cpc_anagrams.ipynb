      "None of these outcomes are recognizable English words, therefore, it's neither a Caesar cipher using simple alphabetic shift nor an anagram resulting in an English word using the English Alphabet. The ciphertext \"psbcd\" may contain a typo, require a different kind of decryption, or be in a different language.\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "After trying to rearrange the letters of \"uirxj\", I have not found any valid English words. Thus, it seems less probable that the ciphertext is an anagram. \n",

      "Let's now assume it's a Caesar cipher, and try to decrypt it. In this case, I'll have to test shifting each letter by each possible position in the alphabet. As there are 26 letters in the alphabet, I'll have to test 25 shifts (no need to test a shift of 26 as it will return the original text).\n",

      "Hence, I will now proceed with the assumption that the sequence is a Caesar cipher. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies on shifting the alphabet by a set number. As the set number of shifts isn't given, I'll attempt to decode it by shifting from 1 to 25 times.\n",

      "-----------------\n",
